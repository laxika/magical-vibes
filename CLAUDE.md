- Do not use `cd` in Bash commands. The working directory is already correct and persists between calls.
- Do not start committing changes until I tell you to do so.
- Make sure that the way we are implementing the cards and the rules is accurate. Having non-rules-correct behavior in the engine is not fine nor acceptable!
- If you need any rules clarification feel free to search the web! Being rules accurate is our number one priority.
- When implementing cards always try to create reusable components (effects, abilities, etc) that could be reused for other cards as well.
- If you can recreate an effect by combining existing ones then do not create a new class for it. For example "Orcish Artillery deals 2 damage to any target and 3 damage to you." could be achieved by combining DealDamageToAnyTargetEffect with DealDamageToControllerEffect.
- If you can reuse an effect by adding predicates to it then do so. Whenever creating new effect try to add parameters as predicates. Instead of DestroyTargetArtifactEffect create a DestroyTargetPermanentEffect that accepts a PermanentPredicate.
- If you create new effects, etc then make sure to update the files in the agent-docs folder.
- If you need to implement a new card, first run a reprint check to see if the card class already exists: `grep -r "class CardName " magical-vibes-card/src/` (replace `CardName` with the PascalCase class name). If the class exists, just add the `@CardRegistration` annotation for the new printing and do nothing else (do not run/check tests, etc).
- If unit tests exists for the service classes that you need to extend, then make sure that you create unit tests as well for the new features you add to those services.
- When running the full test suite, always use `run_in_background: true` on the Bash tool call. The tests take over 20 minutes, which exceeds the maximum timeout.
- Always call Scryfall with curl instead of the built in fetcher (use random heades). For quick lookups, use `bash scripts/scryfall-lookup.sh <SET> <COLLECTOR_NUMBER>` (e.g. `bash scripts/scryfall-lookup.sh DKA 29`) — it returns only `name`, `mana_cost`, `type_line`, `oracle_text`, `power`, `toughness`, and `keywords`.

## Documentation

When implementing a card, follow this lookup order:
1. **CARD_PATTERN_INDEX.md** — **Check this first.** Find the closest archetype, read the reference card, and use the copy-paste template if one exists. This is the fastest path for most cards.
2. **ORACLE_TEXT_EFFECT_MAP.md** — If the pattern index doesn't cover your case, search here to map oracle text phrases to effect classes + slots.
3. **EFFECTS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** — Compact lookup of all ~210 effects. Check when the oracle text map doesn't cover your case.
4. Only consult the detailed docs below when the above aren't enough.

Full agent-docs reference:
- EFFECTS_INDEX.md — Full details for every effect (detailed descriptions, usage notes).
- ACTIVATED_ABILITY_GUIDE.md — All ActivatedAbility constructor overloads with "use this when" guidance, EffectSlot reference (all 28 slots with when each fires), and cost effects.
- PREDICATES_REFERENCE.md — Complete reference for all TargetFilter types, PermanentPredicate, StackEntryPredicate, and PlayerPredicate compositions. Includes dynamic/game-state predicates that need FilterContext.
- TRIGGER_SLOT_TARGETING.md — Per-trigger-slot matrix of which targeting features the engine currently supports. **Check this before implementing a targeted triggered ability.**

## Architecture

Gradle multi-module project: a collectible card game with WebSocket-based real-time multiplayer.

### Module Dependency Graph

```
backend → card → domain
       → websocket → networking → domain
```

- **`magical-vibes-domain`** — Core domain model: `Card`, `Permanent`, `GameData`, `StackEntry`, `ManaPool`, `ManaCost`, enums (`CardType`, `CardColor`, `CardSubtype`, `Keyword`, `TurnStep`), and all `CardEffect` records (in `model/effect/`).
- **`magical-vibes-networking`** — Wire protocol: WebSocket message records (in `message/`), view DTOs (`CardView`, `PermanentView`, `StackEntryView`), and their factory services (`CardViewFactory`, `PermanentViewFactory`, `StackEntryViewFactory`). The `SessionManager` interface and `Connection` interface live here too.
- **`magical-vibes-card`** — Card definitions: each card is a `Card` subclass (organized in alphabetical subpackages like `cards/a/`, `cards/b/`), annotated with `@CardRegistration(set, collectorNumber)`. `CardSet` enum discovers printings at runtime via `CardScanner` (ClassGraph classpath scan). `CardPrinting` stamps `setCode`/`collectorNumber`/`flavorText` onto cards.
- **`magical-vibes-websocket`** — WebSocket infrastructure: `WebSocketSessionManager` (implements `SessionManager`), `WebSocketHandler`, Spring config. Depends on networking for the `SessionManager` interface.
- **`magical-vibes-backend`** — Spring Boot application. `GameMessageHandler` dispatches WebSocket messages to `LoginService`, `LobbyService`, or `GameService`. `GameService` is the game engine (~1700 lines): turn progression, combat, stack resolution, effect dispatch.
- **`magical-vibes-frontend`** — Angular standalone components. `websocket.service.ts` defines all TypeScript interfaces (`Card`, `Permanent`, `Game`, `StackEntry`) and handles WebSocket communication. `game.component.ts` is the main game UI.

### Key Patterns

- **Jackson 3.x**: Import `tools.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper` (not `com.fasterxml`).
- **Domain model is mutable, views are immutable**: `Card` uses `@Setter` with defaults; `Permanent` has mutable state. View records (`CardView`, `PermanentView`) are created by factory services for serialization — never mutate domain objects for serialization purposes.
- **Effect system**: Effects are records implementing the marker interface `CardEffect`. `GameService.resolveStackEntry()` dispatches each effect to a `resolve*` method via `instanceof` pattern matching.
- **Static/continuous effects**: Computed on-the-fly via `computeStaticBonus()` and baked into `PermanentView`, never stored on the `Permanent`.
- **Thread safety**: `GameData` uses `ConcurrentHashMap` + `synchronized(gameData)` blocks in `GameService`. Validation checks must go INSIDE synchronized blocks.
- **Frontend signals**: `game = signal<Game | null>(null)`, updated via spread + `game.set()`. RxJS Subjects for WebSocket messages.

### Scryfall Oracle Data

All card metadata (name, type, mana cost, color, supertypes, subtypes, card text, power/toughness, keywords) comes from Scryfall via `ScryfallOracleLoader`. On startup, `ScryfallDataService` (`@PostConstruct`) fetches oracle data for each set in `CardSet`, caches it to `./scryfall-cache/`, and populates `Card.oracleRegistry`. Card subclass constructors contain only game-engine logic (effects, abilities, targeting) — metadata is auto-populated from the registry via `Card`'s no-arg constructor. Tests load the registry via `GameTestHarness` (first run requires network; subsequent runs use disk cache).

### Adding a New Card

1. Create card class in `magical-vibes-card/src/main/java/.../cards/{letter}/CardName.java` extending `Card`.
2. Constructor: only add game-engine logic — `addEffect()`, `addActivatedAbility()`, `setNeedsTarget()`, `setNeedsSpellTarget()`, `setTargetFilter()`. All metadata (name, type, mana cost, color, subtypes, keywords, power/toughness, card text) is loaded automatically from Scryfall. Cards with no special abilities have an empty class body.
3. Add `@CardRegistration(set = "SET", collectorNumber = "collectorNumber")` annotation(s) to the card class. For multiple printings (e.g. basic lands), use multiple annotations.
4. If the card introduces a new effect, create a record in `magical-vibes-domain/.../model/effect/` implementing `CardEffect`, then add resolution logic in `GameService.resolveStackEntry()`.
5. If Scryfall returns subtypes or keywords not yet in our enums (`CardSubtype`, `Keyword`), add the new enum values.
6. Update `CardView`/`CardViewFactory` if the new effect requires a new boolean flag on the view.
7. Update the frontend `Card` interface in `websocket.service.ts` to match.

### Testing Cards

Tests live in `magical-vibes-backend/src/test/java/.../cards/{letter}/CardNameTest.java`. All card tests extend `BaseCardTest` which provides common fields (`harness`, `player1`, `player2`, `gs`, `gqs`, `gd`) and `@BeforeEach setUp()`. Key harness methods: `skipMulligan()`, `setHand()`, `addMana()`, `addToBattlefield()`, `castCreature()`, `castInstant()`, `activateAbility()`, `passBothPriorities()`, `forceStep()`, `forceActivePlayer()`. Tests use JUnit 5 + AssertJ.

Do NOT test Scryfall-loaded metadata (name, type, mana cost, color, power, toughness, subtypes, keywords) in card tests — card metadata is auto-loaded from Scryfall and doesn't require engine-side verification. Card tests should only verify engine logic: effects, abilities, targeting, game interactions.
