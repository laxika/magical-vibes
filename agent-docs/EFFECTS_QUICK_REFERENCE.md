# EFFECTS_QUICK_REFERENCE

Compact lookup: effect name + constructor signature, organized by category.
For detailed descriptions, targeting info, and examples, see EFFECTS_INDEX.md.

**How to use:** Search this file for keywords from the card text (e.g. "graveyard", "life", "shuffle", "destroy"). Once you find a candidate effect, grep EFFECTS_INDEX.md for its name to get full details.

- `RegisterDelayedReturnSourceTransformedEffect()` — ON_DEATH effect that registers a delayed end-step return from the source card's owner's graveyard to the battlefield transformed. Used by Loyal Cathar-style "When this dies, return it transformed at the beginning of the next end step."
- `RegisterDelayedCreateTokenEffect(CreateTokenEffect tokenEffect)` — registers a delayed trigger that resolves `tokenEffect` at the beginning of the next end step, creating the token(s) under the resolving controller's control. Used by Rukh Egg-style "When this dies, create a ... token at the beginning of the next end step."
- `RegisterCombatDamageReflectionEffect()` — "This turn, whenever an attacking creature deals combat damage to you, it deals that much damage to its controller" (Harsh Justice). Registers a `DelayedCombatDamageReflection` for the rest of the turn; `CombatDamageService` reflects each attacking creature's player-damage back to its controller. Pair with `setSpellCastTimingRestriction(DECLARE_ATTACKERS_IF_ATTACKED)`.

## Targeting rules (summary)

- Effects in SPELL slot with `canTargetPlayer()=true` force player targeting at cast time.
- Effects in SPELL slot with `canTargetPermanent()=true` force permanent targeting at cast time.
- ETB/triggered/saga slots: targeting declarations don't force spell-level targeting.
- `CostEffect` subtypes are excluded from targeting computation.
- Targeting is computed by `EffectResolution.needsTarget(card)` / `needsSpellCastTarget(card)`.
- Never call `setNeedsTarget`/`setNeedsSpellTarget` directly.

## Marker interfaces

- `CostEffect` — additional costs (sacrifice, discard, exile, counter removal, tap creature)
- `ManaProducingEffect` — mana abilities (CR 605.1a)
- `DamageDealingEffect` — deals a `DynamicAmount` to one target category; `damageAmount()`,
  `canDamageCreatures()`, `canDamagePlayers()`. Implemented by `DealDamageToAnyTargetEffect`,
  `DealDamageToTargetCreatureEffect`, `DealDamageToPlayersEffect` (descriptive; AI evaluators
  read it instead of `instanceof`-ing each concrete burn type)
- `RemovalEffect` — single-target destroy/exile/bounce; `removalKind()` returns `RemovalKind`
  (`DESTROY`/`EXILE`/`BOUNCE`) or `null` when not single-target removal (e.g. mass bounce).
  Implemented by `DestroyTargetPermanentEffect`, `ExileTargetPermanentEffect`,
  `ReturnTargetPermanentToHandWithManaValueConditionalEffect`, `ReturnToHandEffect` (TARGET scope)

## Wrapper / modifier effects

Core wrappers (all take `CardEffect wrapped` as first/only effect arg):
- `MayEffect(CardEffect, String prompt)` — "you may"
- `MayPayManaEffect(String manaCost, CardEffect, String prompt)` — "you may pay {X}"
- `MayPayTapPermanentsEffect(TapMultiplePermanentsCost, CardEffect, String prompt)` — "you may tap N permanents"
- `ConditionalEffect(new Metalcraft(), CardEffect)` — 3+ artifacts
- `ConditionalEffect(new SpellManaSpentAtLeast(minMana), wrapped)` — mana spent to cast triggering spell >= N
- `ConditionalEffect(new Morbid(), CardEffect)` — creature died this turn
- `ConditionalEffect(new Raid(), CardEffect)` — attacked this turn
- `ConditionalEffect(new ControllerCastAnotherSpellThisTurn(filter), wrapped)` — another spell matching filter cast this turn (excludes resolving spell)
- `ConditionalEffect(new NotCondition(inner), wrapped)` — logical negation of any condition ("unless …"), e.g. Hotheaded Giant enters with -1/-1 counters `new NotCondition(new ControllerCastAnotherSpellThisTurn(new CardColorPredicate(RED)))`
- `TriggeringCardConditionalEffect(CardPredicate, CardEffect)` — triggering card matches predicate
- `TriggeringPermanentConditionalEffect(PermanentPredicate, CardEffect)` — triggering permanent matches predicate
- `ConditionalEffect(new ControlsAnotherPermanent(filter), wrapped)` — controls another matching permanent
- `ConditionalEffect(new ControllerLifeAtLeast(threshold), wrapped)` — life >= N
- `ConditionalEffect(new ControllerHasMoreLifeThanAnOpponent(), wrapped)` — you have strictly more life than at least one opponent (Feudkiller's Verdict)

Metalcraft / Morbid / Raid / ControlsAnotherPermanent are ETB trigger gates
(`Condition.isEtbTriggerGate()`): a targeted ETB wrapped in one never asks for its target at cast
time — the target is chosen as the trigger goes on the stack (see TRIGGER_SLOT_TARGETING.md,
"ON_ENTER_BATTLEFIELD targeted triggers"). Override `isEtbTriggerGate()` when adding a new
intervening-if condition used to gate a targeted ETB.
- `ConditionalEffect(new ControllerTurn(), CardEffect)` — during your turn
- `ConditionalEffect(new NotControllerTurn(), CardEffect)` — during turns other than yours
- `ConditionalEffect(new ControlsPermanent(filter), wrapped)` — controls matching
- `EnchantedPermanentConditionalEffect(PermanentPredicate, CardEffect ifMatch, CardEffect ifNotMatch)` — aura active branch based on enchanted permanent predicate
- `ConditionalEffect(new OpponentControlsPermanent(filter), wrapped)` — opponent controls matching
- `ConditionalEffect(new OpponentControlsMoreLands(), wrapped)` — an opponent controls strictly more lands than you (Gift of Estates)
- `ConditionalEffect(new HasAttacker(predicate), wrapped)` — one or more matching attackers
- `CantAttackUnlessEffect(Condition, "unless clause")` — STATIC attack restriction; condition = `ControlsPermanentCount(1, filter)` / `DefendingPlayerControlsPermanent(filter)` / `AnyPlayerControlsPermanentCount(N, filter)` / `DefendingPlayerPoisoned()` / `OpponentDealtDamageThisTurn(minAmount)`
- `CantAttackOrBlockUnlessGreaterPowerAlsoDoesEffect()` — STATIC combat-set restriction (Okk): can't attack unless another declared attacker has strictly greater power; can't block unless another declared blocker has strictly greater power. Validated against the current combat's declared set in `CombatAttackService`/`CombatBlockService`, not via `Condition`
- `CreaturesCantAttackUnlessPredicateEffect(PermanentPredicate exemption)` — STATIC global: no creature can attack unless it matches exemption (Stormtide Leviathan)
- `CreaturesCantAttackControllerUnlessPredicateEffect(PermanentPredicate exemption)` — STATIC defender-scoped: creatures not matching exemption can't attack THIS controller only ("creatures without flying can't attack you", Form of the Dragon → exemption `PermanentHasKeywordPredicate(Keyword.FLYING)`)
- `ControlledCreaturesCantAttackUnlessPredicateEffect(PermanentPredicate exemption)` — STATIC controller-scoped: creatures the source's controller controls that don't match exemption can't attack (own team only; source exempt if it matches). "Non-Eye creatures you control can't attack", Evil Eye of Orms-by-Gore → exemption `PermanentHasSubtypePredicate(EYE)`
- `CreaturesWithPowerGreaterThanAmountCantAttackEffect(DynamicAmount amount)` — STATIC global: any creature (either player's) whose effective power is strictly greater than `amount` can't attack. `amount` is evaluated from the source's controller (`AmountContext.forStaticEffect`). Ensnaring Bridge → `new CardsInHand(CountScope.CONTROLLER)` ("power greater than the number of cards in your hand can't attack")
- `ConditionalEffect(new GraveyardCardThreshold(threshold, filter), wrapped)` — graveyard threshold
- `ConditionalEffect(new CardsInLibraryAtLeast(threshold), wrapped)` — controller has N+ cards in library (Battle of Wits: upkeep + WinGameEffect)
- `ConditionalEffect(new AnyLibraryAtMost(threshold), wrapped)` — some player's library has N or fewer cards (Shelldock Isle: `{U}, {T}` + PlayImprintedCardWithoutPayingManaCostEffect, threshold 20)
- `ConditionalEffect(new CardsInHandAtLeast(threshold), wrapped)` — controller has N+ cards in hand (Imaginary Pet: upkeep + ReturnToHandEffect.self())
- `ConditionalEffect(new SourceCounterThreshold(threshold, counterType), wrapped)` — source counter threshold (e.g. 5+ growth counters)
- `ConditionalEffect(new ControlledCreaturesTotalPowerAtLeast(threshold), wrapped)` — total power of creatures you control >= N (Mosswort Bridge)
- `EnteringCreatureMinPowerConditionalEffect(int, CardEffect)` — entering power >= N
- `EnteringCreatureMaxPowerConditionalEffect(int, CardEffect)` — entering power <= N

Replacement wrappers (pick between base/upgraded at resolution):
- `ConditionalReplacementEffect(new Metalcraft(), baseEffect, upgradedEffect)(CardEffect base, CardEffect metalcraft)`
- `ConditionalReplacementEffect(new Morbid(), baseEffect, upgradedEffect)(CardEffect base, CardEffect morbid)`
- `ConditionalReplacementEffect(new Raid(), baseEffect, upgradedEffect)(CardEffect base, CardEffect raid)`
- `ConditionalReplacementEffect(new Kicked(), baseEffect, upgradedEffect)(CardEffect base, CardEffect kicked)`
- `ConditionalReplacementEffect(new ControlsPermanent(filter), baseEffect, upgradedEffect)(PermanentPredicate, CardEffect base, CardEffect upgraded)`
- `ConditionalReplacementEffect(new TargetPermanentMatches(filter), baseEffect, upgradedEffect)(PermanentPredicate, CardEffect base, CardEffect upgraded)` — target permanent predicate

Other wrappers:
- `ChooseOneEffect(List<ChooseOneOption>)` — modal spell
- `FlipCoinWinEffect(CardEffect win)` or `(CardEffect win, CardEffect lost)` — flip a coin; run `win` if won, `lost` if lost (`lost` optional, defaults to nothing). Bottle of Suleiman: `(CreateTokenEffect(5/5 Djinn), DealDamageToPlayersEffect(5, CONTROLLER))`
- `ManaClashEffect()` — repeat: you + target opponent flip coins, 1 dmg per tails, until both heads
- `NthSpellCastTriggerEffect(int, List<CardEffect>)` — Nth spell trigger
- `ConditionalEffect(new NoSpellsCastLastTurn(), CardEffect)` — werewolf front
- `ConditionalEffect(new TwoOrMoreSpellsCastLastTurn(), CardEffect)` — werewolf back
- `ConditionalEffect(new CastFromZone(sourceZone), wrapped)` — resolves wrapped effect only if cast from that zone (`Zone.HAND` / `Zone.GRAVEYARD`)
- `ConditionalEffect(new CastNotFromHand(), CardEffect)` — resolves wrapped effect only if cast from anywhere other than hand (e.g. flashback)
- `ConditionalEffect(new Kicked(), CardEffect)` — kicked adds effect

See EFFECTS_INDEX.md for 20+ additional conditional wrappers (poison, blocker count, etc.)

## Damage

> **Power-based damage convention.** Any effect that deals damage equal to a creature's power
> (fight, bite, Pack Hunt, Berserker, Arc-Lightning-style source damage, planeswalker
> power-to-loyalty, `TargetDealsPowerDamageToTargetEffect`,
> `FightTargetsEffect`, `MassFightTargetCreatureEffect`,
> `SourceFightsTargetCreatureEffect`, the `SourcePower` dynamic amount,
> `PackHuntEffect`) must read the amount via
> `gameQueryService.getPowerBasedDamage(gameData, source)` — **never** via
> `getEffectivePower` with a manual `> 0` guard. The helper clamps negative power to 0 per
> CR 510.1a so the damage primitives never see negative values.

- "If this is the Nth time this ability has resolved this turn, [X]" — `ConditionalEffect(new NthAbilityResolutionThisTurn(n), X)` on an activated ability; the engine counts resolutions per source permanent (`GameData.permanentAbilityResolutionsThisTurn`), condition is met only on the exact n-th resolution. Ashling the Pilgrim = `PutCountersOnSelfEffect(PLUS_ONE_PLUS_ONE)` + `ConditionalEffect(NthAbilityResolutionThisTurn(3), RemoveAllCountersFromSelfEffect(PLUS_ONE_PLUS_ONE))` + `ConditionalEffect(NthAbilityResolutionThisTurn(3), MassDamageEffect(new EventValue(), true))`
- `InnerFlameIgniterEffect()` — **card-specific.** On the exact third resolution this turn, creatures you control gain first strike until end of turn. Pair with `BoostAllOwnCreaturesEffect(1, 0)` in the same ability for the unconditional +1/+0 (Inner-Flame Igniter)
- `DealDamageToPlayersEffect(DynamicAmount, DamageRecipient)`; `(int, recipient)`; `.enchantedAttachedCount(PermanentPredicate)` — **unified player damage.** Recipients: `TARGET_PLAYER` (only targeting one; `Fixed`/`CardsInGraveyard` Scrapyard Salvo/`CardsInHand(TARGET_PLAYER)` Sudden Impact + Sword of War and Peace), `EACH_OPPONENT` (single eval, same value; `Fixed`/`CountersOnSource` Hallar), `EACH_PLAYER` (Slagstorm), `CONTROLLER` (self/pain lands), `ENCHANTED_PLAYER` (curse upkeep; `.enchantedAttachedCount` Curse of Thirst), `TARGET_PERMANENT_CONTROLLER` (Chandra's Outrage), `TRIGGERING_PERMANENT_CONTROLLER` (Magnetic Mine)
- `DealDamageIfDidntCastSpellThisTurnEffect(int damage)` — `END_STEP_TRIGGERED`: deals N damage to the end-step player (`entry.getTargetId()`, baked to the active player by StepTriggerService) if that player didn't cast a spell this turn. Intervening-if checked at trigger and resolution (Impatience)

- `MassDamageEffect(DynamicAmount, damagesPlayers, damagesPlaneswalkers, PermanentPredicate)` — mass damage; convenience ctors `(int)`, `(int, damagesPlayers)`, `(DynamicAmount, damagesPlayers)`, `(int, usesXValue, damagesPlayers, filter)` (+ planeswalker overload)
- `DealDamageToAnyTargetAndGainLifeEffect(int damage, int lifeGain)` — damage + life gain
- `DealDamageToAnyTargetEqualToControlledSubtypeCountAndGainLifeEffect(CardSubtype, boolean)` — any target = subtype count
- `DealDividedDamageEffect` (unified divided/multi-target damage) — factories: `.chosenAmongAnyTargets(int)` (Fight with Fire kicked), `.chosenAmongAnyTargets(DynamicAmount)` (Jaws of Stone — dynamic total, e.g. Mountains you control, divided among any targets), `.chosenAmongTargetCreatures(int)` (Ignite Disorder), `.chosenAmongAnyTargetsEtb(int,int)` (Inferno Titan/Bogardan ETB), `.xAmongAttackingCreatures()` (Hail of Arrows), `.xAmongTargetCreaturesCantBlock()` (Huatli −X), `.xDividedEvenly()` (Fireball), `.ordered(List<Integer>)` (Cone of Flame/Arc Trail)

- `TargetCreatureDealsPowerDamageToControllerEffect()` — target creature deals its power to that creature's controller; the creature is the damage source (Dong Zhou, the Tyrant, ETB)
- `DiscardRandomCardDealDiscardedPowerToTargetPlayerOrPlaneswalkerEffect()` — discard a card at random; if it's a creature card, source deals damage equal to that card's power to target player/planeswalker (Cragganwick Cremator ETB). Target always chosen; non-creature discard = no damage
- `FightTargetsEffect()` — fight (group indices `(firstTargetGroup, secondTargetGroup)` default to 0, 1)
- `MassFightTargetCreatureEffect()` — Alpha Brawl-style mass fight
- `PreventNextDamageToSelfEffect(int amount)` — activated ability (no target): "Prevent the next N damage that would be dealt to this creature this turn" (Ethereal Champion). Shields the ability's own source permanent via its `damagePreventionShield`; next N damage from any source (combat or noncombat), then consumed. Hooked in `PreventNextDamageToSelfEffectHandler`
- `PreventDividedDamageEffect(int amount)` — SPELL (no `target()` call): "Prevent the next N damage that would be dealt this turn to any number of targets, divided as you choose" (Remedy). Per-target shield amounts come from the cast-time `damageAssignments` map (harness `castInstant(player, idx, Map)`), summing to N; each target (creature and/or player) gets a "next X damage" shield via `PreventDividedDamageEffectHandler`. Reuses the damage-distribution cast flow (`EffectResolution.needsDamageDistribution`). Shields expire at end of turn
- `PreventNoncombatDamageToControllerAndGainLifeEffect()` — STATIC: prevent all noncombat damage to controller; they gain life equal to the damage prevented (Purity). Hooked in `DamageSupport.dealDamageToPlayer`

- `PreventSpellDamageToOpponentAndCreateTokensEffect(CreateTokenEffect token)` — STATIC: if a spell you control would deal damage to an opponent, prevent it and create one `token` per 1 damage prevented (Hostility). Hooked in `DamageSupport.dealDamageToPlayer`
- `PreventAllDamageToTargetCreatureEffect()` — prevent all damage to target creature this turn (Wellgabber Apothecary). Adds target to `GameData.creaturesWithAllDamagePrevented`, checked in `DamagePreventionService.applyCreaturePreventionShield`, cleared at turn cleanup
- `PreventAllDamageByTargetCreatureEffect()` / `(boolean combatOnly)` — prevent all damage target creature(s) would deal this turn (Soul Parry, Inquisitor's Snare). `combatOnly=true` prevents only combat damage via `GameData.creaturesPreventedFromDealingCombatDamage`, gating attacker participation in `CombatDamageService` (Resistance Fighter). Cleared at turn cleanup
- `PreventAllDamageToControllerFromAttackingCreaturesEffect()` — SPELL: prevent all damage attacking creatures would deal to the controller this turn (Deep Wood).

- `PreventDamageToOtherCreaturesAndAddPlusCountersEffect()` — STATIC: prevent all damage (combat or noncombat, any source) to *another* creature you control and put a +1/+1 counter on it per 1 damage prevented (Vigor). Checked in `DamagePreventionService.applyCreaturePreventionShield`; the effect is on a different permanent than the one being damaged
- `PreventDamageToSelfAndSourceControllerDrawsEffect()` — STATIC: "If a source would deal damage to this creature, prevent that damage. The source's controller draws cards equal to the damage prevented this way" (Swans of Bryn Argoll). Prevents all damage (combat + noncombat, any source) to the permanent carrying it; the source's controller draws one card per point prevented. Via `DamagePreventionService.applySwansSourceControllerDraw`, hooked in `DamageSupport.dealCreatureDamage` (noncombat, covers burn/mass/bite) and `CombatDamageService.applyCombatCreatureDamage` (combat, per source)
- `PreventNextDamageFromChosenColoredSourceEffect(CardColor color)` — one-shot: prevent the *next* damage event a chosen source of that color would deal to you this turn (Circle of Protection cycle). Source chosen on resolution; shield in `GameData.playerSourceNextDamageShields`, consumed by `DamagePreventionService.applyPlayerNextSourceDamageShield`
- `PreventNextDamageFromChosenSourceEffect(boolean gainLife)` — one-shot: prevent the *next* damage event a chosen source (any color) would deal to you this turn (Reverse Damage with `gainLife=true`, also gains that much life; Pentagram of the Ages with `gainLife=false`, no life gain, as a `{4},{T}` ability). Source chosen on resolution; shield in `GameData.playerSourceNextDamageShields` with the given `gainLife`, consumed by `DamagePreventionService.applyPlayerNextSourceDamageShield` (which grants any life via `LifeSupport`)
- `PreventNextDamageFromChosenSourceToAnyTargetEffect()` — one-shot: prevent the *next* damage event a chosen source (any color) would deal to **any** target this turn — player, planeswalker, or creature, combat or noncombat (Sanctum Guardian; usually an activated ability with `SacrificeSelfCost`).

- `RedirectTargetCreatureDamageFromChosenSourceToSelfEffect()` — activated ability targeting a creature: all damage a chosen source (picked on resolution) would deal to that creature this turn is dealt to the source permanent instead (Oracle's Attendants). Shield in `GameData.creatureDamageRedirectShields`, checked in both combat and noncombat creature-damage paths via `DamagePreventionService.applyCreatureRedirectShields`; reuses `pendingSourceRedirectDamage`
- `RedirectTargetCreatureNextDamageFromChosenSourceToControllerEffect()` — activated ability targeting a creature: the next single damage event a chosen source (picked on resolution) would deal to that creature this turn is dealt to the ability's controller (you) instead, then consumed (Jade Monolith). Same `creatureDamageRedirectShields` machinery as Oracle's Attendants, but redirects to a player and only for the next event (`CreatureDamageRedirectShield.NEXT_EVENT`)

See EFFECTS_INDEX.md "Damage" section for 15+ additional niche damage effects.

## Destruction / sacrifice

- `DestroyTargetPermanentEffect(boolean cantRegen)` or `(boolean, CreateTokenEffect)` — destroy target

- `DestroyAllPermanentsEffect(PermanentPredicate)` or `(PermanentPredicate, boolean)` — board wipe
- `DestroyAllPermanentsAndGainLifePerDestroyedEffect(PermanentPredicate, int)` — wipe + life
- `DestroyCreaturesTargetPlayerControlsAndLoseLifePerDestroyedEffect(int)` — destroy creatures target player controls; controller loses N life per destroyed. Needs `target(...)` a player

- `DestroyTargetPermanentAndControllerSearchesLibraryToBattlefieldEffect(CardPredicate, boolean may[, boolean tapped])` — destroy + controller searches to battlefield (tapped optional, e.g. Erode)
- `DestroyTargetAndEachPlayerSearchesBasicLandToBattlefieldEffect()` — destroy + each searches
- `EachOpponentMaySearchLibraryForBasicLandToBattlefieldTappedEffect()` — opponents search
- `EachOpponentMaySearchLibraryForCreatureToBattlefieldEffect()` — each opponent may tutor a creature onto the battlefield (untapped), then shuffle; APNAP; Boldwyr Heavyweights
- `PutCreatureFromHandThenSacrificeUnlessPayReducedEffect(int genericReduction)` — SPELL: you may put a creature from your hand onto the battlefield; then sacrifice it unless you pay its mana cost reduced by `{genericReduction}` (generic only, floored at 0). Declinable card choice + a resolution-time pay-or-sacrifice may ability; Flash (`2`)

- `DestroyTargetPermanentThenEffect(EventStat, CardEffect thenEffect, ThenEffectRecipient[, PermanentPredicate])` — collapsed destroy-plus-value family. Destroy the target, then resolve an existing then-effect. `recipient` CONTROLLER (you) / TARGET_CONTROLLER (destroyed permanent's controller). `EventStat` NONE/MANA_VALUE/TOUGHNESS snapshots the destroyed permanent's last-known stat onto `eventValue` for a `GainLifeEffect(EventValue())` / `BoostSelfEffect(EventValue(), Fixed(0))` then-effect. Then-effects: `GainLifeEffect`, `BoostSelfEffect`, `LoseLifeEffect`, `GivePoisonCountersEffect`. Optional `PermanentPredicate` gates the then-effect on the destroyed permanent's state (Death's Caress HUMAN). Then-effect happens even if destruction fails (indestructible)
- `DestroySourcePermanentEffect()` — destroy source
- `DestroyEnchantedPermanentEffect()` — destroy the permanent the source Aura is attached to (Spreading Algae, on `ON_ENCHANTED_PERMANENT_TAPPED`)
- `DestroyCreatureBlockingThisEffect()` — destroy blocker

- `DestroySelfAtEndOfCombatEffect()` — schedule the **source** permanent for destruction at end of combat (regeneration/indestructible apply, unlike `SacrificeAtEndOfCombatEffect`). "When this creature blocks/attacks, destroy it at end of combat." Put on ON_BLOCK / ON_ATTACK. Cinder Wall
- `PutMinusOneCounterOnSourceAtEndOfCombatEffect()` — schedule the **source** permanent to get a -1/-1 counter at end of combat (delayed, so it stays full size during combat damage — unlike immediate `PutCountersOnSourceEffect(-1,-1,1)`).

- `SacrificePermanentsEffect(count, PermanentPredicate, SacrificeRecipient)` — collapsed forced-sacrifice family. `SacrificeRecipient` = CONTROLLER / TARGET_PLAYER / EACH_PLAYER / EACH_OPPONENT. Bare `PermanentIsCreaturePredicate` → single-select "sacrifice a creature" (Cruel Edict, Grave Pact, Stitcher's Apprentice); any other filter → multi-permanent choice (Storm Fleet Arsonist, Yawning Fissure, Destructive Force). int-count sugar ctor
- `TargetPlayerChoosesCreatureDestroyEffect()` — SPELL, `canTargetPlayer`: target opponent chooses a creature they control, then it is **destroyed** (regeneration/indestructible apply — this is the destroy analog of the "sacrifice a creature" edict). 0 creatures ⇒ nothing; 1 ⇒ auto; 2+ ⇒ target picks. Imperial Edict
- `OpponentChoosesCreatureToDestroyEffect()` — non-targeting: an opponent of the controller chooses **any** creature on the battlefield and it is destroyed (regeneration/indestructible apply). 0 ⇒ nothing; 1 ⇒ auto; 2+ ⇒ opponent picks. Pair after `DestroyTargetPermanentEffect` for "destroy target creature of your choice, then destroy target creature of an opponent's choice" (Diaochan, Artful Beauty)
- `PlayerDestroysPermanentsEffect(count, PermanentPredicate, DestroyRecipient)` — a player chooses and **destroys** N of their own permanents matching the filter (regeneration/indestructible apply — the destroy analog of `SacrificePermanentsEffect`). `DestroyRecipient` = CONTROLLER / TARGET_PLAYER (TARGET_PLAYER makes it `canTargetPlayer`). ≤N matching ⇒ all destroyed, no choice; >N ⇒ player picks which. int-count sugar ctor. "You destroy four lands you control" = `(4, PermanentIsLandPredicate, CONTROLLER)`; Burning of Xinye uses both recipients + `MassDamageEffect(4)`
- `SacrificeCreatureAndControllerGainsLifeEqualToToughnessEffect(boolean sacrificerIsController)` — sacrifice + life = toughness. `false` = target sacrifices (edict, Tribute to Hunger); `true` = controller sacrifices, non-targeting (Doomgape upkeep)
- `EachPlayerSacrificesGreatestManaValueCreatureUnlessPaysEffect()` — non-targeting SPELL: in APNAP order, each player sacrifices the creature they control with the greatest mana value **unless they pay that creature's mana cost**; a player with ties picks which tied creature is at risk. Punisher prompt via the may-ability system (decline or can't-pay ⇒ sacrifice). Tariff. Sequenced by `TariffSupport` + `gameData.tariffRemainingPlayers`; tie-break uses `PermanentChoiceContext.TariffTieBreak`
- `SacrificeCreatureToCreateTokensEqualToToughnessEffect(CreateTokenEffect template, PermanentPredicate filter)` — controller sacrifices a matching creature, then creates X copies of `template` where X = sacrificed creature's toughness (template `amount` ignored). Wrap in `MayEffect` for "you may sacrifice" (e.g. Feed the Pack)
- `TargetPlayerSacrificesCreatureThenCreateTokensIfSubtypeEffect(CardSubtype requiredSubtype, CreateTokenEffect tokenTemplate)` — targets a player (`canTargetPlayer()`); that player sacrifices a creature of their choice, and if it had `requiredSubtype` (last-known info) the same player creates the template tokens under their own control. Warren Weirding ("gains haste until end of turn" → template's `grantedKeywordsUntilEndOfTurn`)
- `SacrificeTargetCreatureThenCreateTokensEqualToPowerEffect(CreateTokenEffect tokenTemplate)` — targets a creature (`canTargetPermanent()`); its controller sacrifices it, then that same player creates X copies of `template` where X = the creature's effective power captured before removal (template `amount` ignored). Mercy Killing (1/1 green-and-white Elf Warrior template). The power-based, targeted, controller-creates analog of `SacrificeCreatureToCreateTokensEqualToToughnessEffect`
- `ForcedCostOrElseEffect(CostEffect, List<CardEffect>[, boolean optional])` — cost-like instruction; if it cannot be performed, resolve fallback effects. `optional=true` makes it a "you may [cost]. If you don't, [fallback]" choice (Yawgmoth Demon); default `false` is mandatory (Archdemon of Greed). Supported costs: `SacrificePermanentCost` (single) and `SacrificeMultiplePermanentsCost` (N of a filter, e.g. Rathi Dragon). Supported fallbacks: `TapPermanentsEffect(SELF)`, `DealDamageToPlayersEffect(CONTROLLER, Fixed)`, `SacrificeSelfEffect`
- `SacrificeAttackingCreaturesEffect(int base, int metalcraft)` — sacrifice attackers
- `EachPlayerReturnsCardsFromGraveyardToBattlefieldEffect(int, CardPredicate)` or `(int, CardPredicate, CounterType)` — mass reanimate; optional trailing `CounterType` = each returned card enters with one such counter (Pyrrhic Revival: `Integer.MAX_VALUE, CardTypePredicate(CREATURE), MINUS_ONE_MINUS_ONE`)
- `ReturnCardsFromControllerGraveyardToBattlefieldEffect(CardPredicate, int)` — return up to N of controller's own graveyard cards to the battlefield (resolution-time choice; non-targeting). Reveillark
- `SacrificeSelfEffect()` — sacrifice self
- `SacrificeSelfThenDealDamageToTargetPlayerEffect(int damage)` — sac source; if sacrificed, deal N to stack entry's targetId player (Booby Trap trigger)
- `SacrificeSelfIfEvokedEffect()` — evoke sacrifice; ON_ENTER_BATTLEFIELD, fires only when cast for evoke cost
- `SacrificeUnlessDiscardCardTypeEffect(CardType)` / `(CardType, boolean random)` — sacrifice unless discard (`random=true` = discard at random, Pillaging Horde; `null` type = any card)
- `SacrificeUnlessReturnOwnPermanentTypeToHandEffect(CardType)` — sacrifice unless bounce own
- `ChampionCreatureEffect(CardSubtype...)` — champion a creature (no subtype = any creature; multiple = inclusive, e.g. Goblin or Shaman); exile on ETB, return when source leaves
- `SacrificeSelfAndDrawCardsEffect(int)` — sacrifice + draw
- `SacrificeAtEndOfCombatEffect()` — sacrifice at EOC
- `SacrificeTargetThenRevealUntilTypeToBattlefieldEffect(Set<CardType>)` — Polymorph
- `RevealUntilNonlandCardsToHandRestToBottomEffect(int)` — reveal until N nonland to hand, rest (lands) to bottom in any order (Fathom Trawl)
- `RevealUntilLandToBattlefieldRestToBottomEffect()` — reveal until a land, put that land onto the battlefield, rest to bottom in any order (Recross the Paths; used as a `ClashEffect` pre-clash body)

See EFFECTS_INDEX.md "Destruction" section for 10+ additional niche destruction/sacrifice effects.

- `PutOnTopOfLibraryInsteadOfDyingEffect()` — if this creature would die, put it on top of its owner's library instead (static replacement, Gravebane Zombie)

## Bounce / return to hand

- `ReturnToHandEffect` — unified bounce, **static factories only**: `.target()` (bounce target), `.targetAndControllerLosesLife(1)` (Vapor Snag), `.self()` (bounce source permanent), `.selfSpell()` (the resolving instant/sorcery returns itself to its owner's hand off the stack instead of the graveyard — Redeem the Lost's won-clash reward), `.allPermanentsMatching(filter)` (mass bounce matching permanents; null = every permanent — pass `PermanentIsCreaturePredicate` for creatures), `.permanentsTargetPlayerControls(filter)` (River's Rebuke), `.permanentsTargetPlayerOwns(filter)` (Hurkyl's Recall, owner-based)

- `ReturnTriggeringLandFromGraveyardToBattlefieldEffect(UUID landCardId)` — Sacred Ground's trigger effect: return the identified land from the graveyard to the battlefield under its owner's control. Register the template with `null` on the `ON_ALLY_LAND_PUT_INTO_GRAVEYARD_BY_OPPONENT` slot; the collector stamps the real card id.
- `ReturnTargetCardOnDeathThisTurnEffect()` — SPELL delayed trigger (Graceful Reprieve): if the targeted creature dies this turn, return that card to the battlefield under its owner's control. Pair with a creature `target(...)`.
- `ReturnTriggeringCardFromGraveyardToBattlefieldEffect()` — triggered-ability effect the death pipeline pushes for the above; returns the stack entry's card from its owner's graveyard to the battlefield. Not added to a card directly.
- `ReturnOneOfEachSubtypeFromGraveyardToHandEffect(List<CardSubtype>)` — one of each subtype
- `PutTargetCardsFromGraveyardOnTopOfLibraryEffect(CardPredicate)` — graveyard to top of library
- `ReturnTargetCardsFromGraveyardToHandEffect(CardPredicate, int)` — up to N cards to hand
- `ShuffleTargetCardsFromGraveyardIntoLibraryEffect(CardPredicate, int)` — target player shuffles N cards
- `ReturnDyingCreatureToBattlefieldAndAttachSourceEffect()` — reanimate + equip

- `PutCardFromOpponentGraveyardOntoBattlefieldEffect(boolean tapped, CardPredicate filter, boolean requireManaValueEqualsX)` — put target card matching `filter` from an opponent's graveyard onto battlefield under your control, correctly tracked as stolen (returns to owner on leaving). `(boolean tapped)` and `()` default to artifact-or-creature + MV==X + mill-X (Geth). Ashen Powder: `(false, new CardTypePredicate(CREATURE), false)` — creature only, any MV, no mill
- `UndyingReturnEffect()` — Undying (CR 702.93) resolution: return the dying card from its owner's graveyard to the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter. Do NOT add to a card directly; it is pushed automatically by `PermanentRemovalService` when a creature with the `UNDYING` keyword dies with no +1/+1 counters. The keyword is loaded from Scryfall.
- `PersistReturnEffect()` — Persist (CR 702.79) resolution: return the dying card from its owner's graveyard to the battlefield with a -1/-1 counter. Do NOT add to a card directly; it is pushed automatically by `PermanentRemovalService` when a creature with the `PERSIST` keyword dies with no -1/-1 counters. The keyword is loaded from Scryfall.
- `PutCreatureFromOpponentGraveyardOntoBattlefieldWithExileEffect()` — opponent's creature with exile

## Draw / discard / hand manipulation

- `DrawCardEffect(DynamicAmount)` or `(int)` — controller draws that many; use `XValue` for "draw X", `PermanentCount`/`CardsInGraveyard`/`CountersOnSource` for "draw a card for each …"
- `DrawCardPerChosenTypeCountEffect()` — "Choose a creature type. Draw a card for each permanent you control of that type" (Distant Melody). Resolution-time creature-type choice (`beginSpellCreatureTypeChoice`, stored on `GameData.chosenSpellSubtype`), Changeling-aware count; draw sibling of `DealDamageToTargetCreatureEqualToChosenTypeCountEffect`
- `GainLifePerChosenTypeCountEffect(int lifePerPermanent)` — "Choose a creature type. You gain `lifePerPermanent` life for each permanent you control of that type" (Luminescent Rain = `(2)`). Resolution-time creature-type choice (`beginSpellCreatureTypeChoice`, stored on `GameData.chosenSpellSubtype`), Changeling-aware count; gains `count*lifePerPermanent` life. Life sibling of `DrawCardPerChosenTypeCountEffect`
- `BoostTargetCreaturePerChosenTypeCountEffect(int powerPer, int toughnessPer)` — "Choose a creature type. Target creature gets `powerPer`/`toughnessPer` until end of turn for each permanent of the chosen type you control" (Pack's Disdain = `(-1, -1)`). Resolution-time creature-type choice (`beginSpellCreatureTypeChoice`, stored on `GameData.chosenSpellSubtype`), Changeling-aware count; applies `count*powerPer`/`count*toughnessPer` as a until-end-of-turn P/T modifier. Boost sibling of `DealDamageToTargetCreatureEqualToChosenTypeCountEffect`; pair with a `PermanentIsCreaturePredicate` target filter
- `PayXLifeDrawXCardsEffect()` — SPELL: resolution-time X choice — controller picks X (capped at current life), pays X life, draws X cards (Necrologia). Pair with `setSpellCastTimingRestriction(YOUR_END_STEP)` for "cast only during your end step"
- `EachPlayerDrawsCardEffect(DynamicAmount)` or `(int)` — each player (turn order) draws that many; the amount is re-evaluated per drawing player, so player-relative amounts (`CardsInGraveyard(..., CONTROLLER)` = each player's own graveyard, Nature's Resurgence) count that player's objects. `XValue()` for "each player draws X" (Prosperity), `int` for a fixed count
- `DrawCardForTargetPlayerEffect(DynamicAmount, boolean requiresUntapped, boolean targets)` or `(int)` — target/entry player draws; `XValue` for "target player draws X"
- `DyingCreatureControllerMayDrawCardEffect()` — ON_ANY_CREATURE_DIES marker: whenever any creature dies, the DYING creature's controller (may be an opponent of the source) may draw a card (Fecundity). Unlike a plain `MayEffect(DrawCardEffect())` on that slot, which offers the draw to the source's controller
- `DefendingPlayerMayDrawCardEffect()` — ON_ATTACK marker: "whenever this creature attacks, defending player may draw a card" (Sibilant Spirit). `CombatAttackService` routes the optional draw to the defending player (or the attacked planeswalker's controller), not the attacking creature's controller. Unlike a plain `MayEffect(DrawCardEffect())`, which offers the draw to the source's controller
- `DyingCreatureControllerDiscardsCardEffect()` — ON_ANY_CREATURE_DIES marker: whenever a qualifying creature dies, the DYING creature's controller (may be an opponent) discards a card (mandatory). Bereavement wraps it in `TriggeringCardConditionalEffect(CardColorPredicate(GREEN), …)` for "a green creature dies"
- `DrawAndDiscardCardEffect(int draw, int discard)` — loot
- `DiscardAndDrawCardEffect(int discard, int draw)` — rummage
- `DiscardEffect(DynamicAmount, DiscardRecipient, boolean random)` — the whole discard family; `recipient` ∈ {`CONTROLLER`, `TARGET_PLAYER`, `EACH_PLAYER`, `EACH_OPPONENT`}, `random` picks chosen vs random discard. `(int, recipient, random)` / `(DynamicAmount, recipient)` / `(int, recipient)` convenience ctors (last two non-random). `CountersOnSource(CHARGE)` for per-charge-counter (Shrine of Limitless Power), `XValue()` for Mind Shatter (`TARGET_PLAYER`, random)
- `RevealHandAndRandomDiscardCardTypeEffect(CardType)` — target player reveals hand, discards one card of type at random (Rag Man, CREATURE); `canTargetPlayer`
- `DiscardHandEffect(DiscardRecipient)` — discard entire hand(s); no-arg = controller
- `DiscardHandUnlessPaysLifeEffect(int lifeCost)` — target player discards their entire hand unless they pay `lifeCost` life; target chooses (can't-pay → auto-discard). Pair with `PlayerPredicateTargetFilter`. Tyrannize (7)
- `DiscardOwnHandThenDrawThatManyEffect()` — discard entire hand, then draw that many
- `TargetPlayerDiscardsThenDrawsThatManyEffect(N)` — target player discards N cards, then draws as many as they discarded (draw = `min(N, hand size)`); `canTargetPlayer`. Forget
- `DiscardThenReturnFromGraveyardToHandEffect(DynamicAmount)` — controller discards `amount` cards, then returns a card from their graveyard to hand for each card discarded this way (returns `min(amount, hand size)`, chosen one at a time). Recall = `XValue()`; pair with a trailing `ExileSpellEffect()`
- `DiscardOwnHandThenDrawEqualToTargetPlayerHandSizeEffect()` — discard entire hand, then draw equal to target player's hand size (counted at draw time)
- `DiscardOwnHandThenDrawEffect(DynamicAmount)` — discard entire hand, then draw equal to a DynamicAmount (evaluated at draw time; independent of discard count). Knollspine Dragon = `DamageDealtToTargetPlayerThisTurn`
- `EachPlayerDiscardsHandThenDrawsThatManyEffect()` — each player (APNAP) discards their entire hand, then draws that many
- `EachPlayerDiscardsAnyNumberThenDrawsThatManyEffect()` — each player (APNAP) discards any number of cards (their choice), then draws that many (Flux)
- `EachPlayerCreatesTokenEffect(CreateTokenEffect token)` — each player (turn order) creates the wrapped `token` under their own control; the token's dynamic amount is re-evaluated per creating player, so `CountScope.CONTROLLER` reads each player's own board (Waiting in the Weeds)
- `EachPlayerPaysAnyLifeForTokensEffect(CreateTokenEffect token)` — starting with controller, each player may pay any amount of life, round-robin until a full round of no payments; each creates one `token` per life paid (Plague of Vermin)
- `ExileTopCardsMayPlayUntilNextTurnEffect(DynamicAmount count)` or `(int count)` — exile top N from library, may play until end of your next turn (owner-relative expiry via `ExileSupport.grantPlayUntilOwnersNextTurn`). Use `EventValue()` for "equal to the excess damage dealt this way" (Archaic's Agony)
- `ExileTopCardOfOpponentLibraryControllerMayPlayThisTurnEffect()` — target opponent exiles the top card of their library; the source's **controller** may play that card (lands and spells, normal costs/timing) until **end of turn** (Knacksaw Clique). Card owned by the opponent; grants `exilePlayPermissions` to the controller + `exilePlayPermissionsExpireEndOfTurn`. Two-player: single opponent derived
- `ExileTargetPermanentMayPlayUntilNextTurnEffect()` — exile the target permanent, its owner may play it until end of their next turn (e.g. Suspend Aggression; pair with a permanent target filter). Tokens exiled this way cease to exist
- `ExileTargetCardFromGraveyardMayPlayUntilNextTurnEffect(CardPredicate filter, boolean ownGraveyardOnly)` — exile a targeted graveyard card matching the filter, controller may play it until end of their next turn (e.g. Practiced Scrollsmith; ETB graveyard-target flow via `MultiGraveyardChoice`)
- `ExileTargetInstantOrSorceryFromOpponentGraveyardMayCastEffect()` — exile a targeted instant/sorcery from an opponent's graveyard; controller may cast it **this turn**, spending mana of any type, and it is exiled instead of going to a graveyard (Nita, Forum Conciliator). Uses `exilePlayPermissions` + `exilePlayPermissionsExpireEndOfTurn` + `exilePlayAnyManaType` + `exileInsteadOfGraveyard`. Targets graveyard (`canTargetGraveyard()`/`canTargetAnyGraveyard()`)
- `PlayTargetCardFromGraveyardWithoutPayingManaCostEffect(CardPredicate filter)` — "you may play target [filter] card from your **own** graveyard without paying its mana cost" (Horde of Notions). On resolution offers a may-play: land → battlefield, else cast for free. Targets graveyard (own-only via `targetsControllersGraveyardOnly()`); routed by `MayCastHandlerService.handlePlayFromGraveyardChoice`
- `PlayImprintedCardWithoutPayingManaCostEffect()` — Hideaway "you may play the exiled card without paying its mana cost" activated ability (Howltooth Hollow). Offers a may-play of the source permanent's imprinted (face-down exiled) card: land → battlefield (counts as the land play for the turn), else cast from exile for free. Routed by `MayCastHandlerService.handlePlayImprintedCardChoice`. Gate with `ConditionalEffect(<play condition>, …)` (e.g. `NoPlayerHasCardsInHand`); pair with `ImprintFromTopCardsEffect(N)` on ON_ENTER_BATTLEFIELD
- `ChooseCardsFromTargetHandEffect(int|DynamicAmount count, List<CardType> excludedTypes[, List<CardType> includedTypes], HandChoiceDestination destination[, boolean returnOnSourceLeave])` — reveal target's hand, caster chooses N card(s) → `DISCARD` / `EXILE` / `TOP_OF_LIBRARY` (Duress, Kitesail Freebooter, Agonizing Memories). `count` accepts an `XValue()` for "choose X cards" (Mind Warp)
- `RevealCardsChooseOneToDiscardEffect(PermanentPredicate countFilter)` — target reveals X cards **of their choice** (X = number of the caster's permanents matching `countFilter`), then the caster picks one for the target to discard (Thieving Sprite, `PermanentHasAnySubtypePredicate(FAERIE)`). Unlike `ChooseCardsFromTargetHandEffect` the rest of the hand stays hidden; two-phase interaction (`RevealCardsFromHandChoice` → `ChooseRevealedCardToDiscardChoice`), phase 1 skipped when the hand is already ≤ X
- `TargetRevealsCardsControllerChoosesDiscardEffect(int revealCount[, int discardCount])` — target player reveals `revealCount` cards **of their choice** from hand (whole hand if fewer); the controller sees only those and picks `discardCount` of them (default 1; fewer if the hand held fewer) for the target to discard (Blackmail = reveal 3/discard 1; Noggin Whack = reveal 3/discard 2). Two-stage `RevealCardsDiscardChoice` interaction, discard picks looped one at a time; `canTargetPlayer()`. Contrast `ChooseCardsFromTargetHandEffect` (whole hand revealed, controller chooses)
- `RevealTargetHandDrawPerMatchingCardEffect(List<CardSubtype> subtypes, List<CardColor> colors)` — target opponent reveals hand; draw one card per card matching any subtype/color (counted once). Pair with `target(PlayerPredicateTargetFilter(OPPONENT))` (Baleful Stare)
- `RevealHandChooseCreatureGainLifeDiscardEffect(List<CardColor> colors)` — target opponent reveals hand; caster chooses one creature card whose colors include any of `colors` (empty = any color), gains life equal to its toughness, then the target discards it. Pair with `target(PlayerPredicateTargetFilter(OPPONENT))`; `canTargetPlayer()` (Talara's Bane = `List.of(GREEN, WHITE)`)
- `DiscardAllCardsOfChosenColorEffect()` — caster chooses a color, target player discards all cards of that color from hand. Pair with `target(PlayerPredicateTargetFilter(ANY))` (Persecute)
- `LookAtHandEffect()` — look at hand
- `LookAtHandChooseNonlandToBottomAndDrawEffect()` — look at target player's hand; caster **may** choose a nonland card (optional decline); if chosen, target reveals it, bottoms it, then draws a card. Pair with `target(PlayerPredicateTargetFilter(ANY))` (Vendilion Clique, `ON_ENTER_BATTLEFIELD`)
- `ShuffleHandIntoLibraryAndDrawEffect()` — wheel
- `PutHandOnBottomOfLibraryAndDrawEffect()` — target player puts hand on bottom of library, draws that many (Teferi's Puzzle Box, `EACH_DRAW_TRIGGERED`)
- `DrawThenPutCardsFromHandOnTopOrBottomOfLibraryEffect(int drawCount, int putCount)` — draw `drawCount`, then choose `putCount` hand cards (multi-select) and put them **all** on top or **all** on the bottom of your library (single top/bottom pick applied to every chosen card). Dream Cache `(3, 2)`. Two chained interactions (`PutCardsFromHandOnLibraryCardChoice` → `PutCardsFromHandOnLibraryDestinationChoice`), reusing the existing choose-multiple-cards + choose-from-list frontend flows
- `EachPlayerShufflesHandAndGraveyardIntoLibraryEffect()` — Timetwister-style
- `EachPlayerKeepsCardsShufflesRestIntoLibraryEffect(int keepCount)` — each player (APNAP order) chooses up to `keepCount` cards in their hand to keep, shuffles the rest into their library; interactive per-player choice (Worldpurge, `keepCount=7`)
- `EachPlayerLosesUnspentManaEffect()` — each player's mana pool is emptied ("loses all unspent mana"; Worldpurge)

## Library manipulation

- `SearchLibraryEffect(DynamicAmount count, CardPredicate filter, LibrarySearchDestination destination, ManaValueBound manaValueBound, int castFromGraveyardCount)` — unified library search (collapsed the `SearchLibraryFor*` family). Convenience: `()` unrestricted-to-hand (Diabolic Tutor), `(filter)` filtered-to-hand, `(filter, destination)`, `(count, filter, destination)`, `(filter, int count, int cfg)` flashback tutor (Increasing Ambition `(null,1,2)`), `(filter, destination, bound)`. destination ∈ `HAND`/`BATTLEFIELD`/`BATTLEFIELD_TAPPED`/`TOP_OF_LIBRARY`; by-name via `CardNamedPredicate` (Squadron Hawk); MV bound via filter + `ManaValueBound` — `(exact, offset)` = X-relative (Citanul Flute, Birthing Pod `(true,1)`, Green Sun's Zenith `CardColorPredicate(GREEN)`), or `(DynamicAmount, exact, offset)` for a board-derived bound (Beseech the Queen — `PermanentCount` of lands controlled, null filter)
- `LibraryOfLatNamEffect()` — SPELL, "an opponent chooses one" of two modes for you: accept schedules a `DrawCardsAtNextUpkeep` delayed draw-3, decline pushes `SearchLibraryEffect()` (tutor to hand). The opponent decides via the may-ability accept/decline prompt (`LibraryOfLatNamEffectHandler` → `MayPenaltyChoiceHandlerService.handleLibraryOfLatNamChoice`). Library of Lat-Nam
- `SearchLibraryForBasicLandsToBattlefieldTappedAndHandEffect()` — Cultivate
- `TargetPlayerSearchesLibraryForBasicLandToBattlefieldTappedEffect()` — target player searches their library for a basic land card, puts it onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffles; targets a player (`canTargetPlayer()=true`), mandatory search that may fail to find; Fertilid
- `SacrificeAnyNumberOfLandsAndSearchThatManyLandsToBattlefieldTappedEffect()` — controller sacrifices any number of their lands (multi-permanent choice, 0 to all), then searches their library for up to that many land cards to the battlefield tapped, then shuffles; search count = lands sacrificed, may fail to find; Scapeshift
- `SacrificeAnyNumberOfPermanentsThenDrawPerSacrificedEffect(PermanentPredicate filter)` — controller sacrifices any number of their permanents matching `filter` (multi-permanent choice, 0 to all), then draws a card for each one sacrificed; Reprocess (`PermanentAnyOfPredicate` of artifact/creature/land)

- `SearchTargetLibraryForCardsToExileEffect(int count)` / `(DynamicAmount count, boolean upTo)` — search target player's library for up to `count` cards, exile them, then that player shuffles (Jester's Cap, count=3); `upTo=true` = "up to X" (may exile fewer), `count` may be a `PermanentCount` (Nightmare Incursion = number of Swamps you control). No play permission. Targets player

- `CastTopOfLibraryWithoutPayingManaCostEffect(Set<CardType>)` — cast top free
- `ImprovisationCapstoneEffect(int totalManaValueThreshold)` — exile from library until total MV ≥ threshold; `ImprovisationCapstoneCastChoice` interaction lets controller cast any number of exiled instants/sorceries/etc. without paying (`ImprovisationCapstoneCastSupport`)

## Mill

- `MillEffect(DynamicAmount, MillRecipient)` — the recipient mills cards. `recipient` ∈ {`CONTROLLER`, `TARGET_PLAYER`, `EACH_OPPONENT`}; `(int, recipient)` ctor for a fixed count. `XValue()` for mills X, `CountersOnSource(CHARGE)` for Grindclock, `CardsInHand(TARGET_PLAYER)` for Dreamborn Muse's hand-size mill. "Each player mills N" = `(N, CONTROLLER)` + `(N, EACH_OPPONENT)`. Flashback "twice X" via `ConditionalReplacementEffect(CastFromZone(GRAVEYARD), Mill(XValue(),TARGET_PLAYER), Mill(Scaled(XValue(),2),TARGET_PLAYER))` (Increasing Confusion)
- `MillControllerAndMayPlayFromGraveyardThisTurnEffect()` — mill 1, grant play-from-graveyard permission until end of turn

## Exile

- `ExileTargetPermanentEffect()` or `(boolean returnEndStep)` — exile target
- `FlickerEffect.exileTargetReturnAtEndStep([boolean tapped])` — exile target + return at end step (SELF: `exileSelfReturnAtEndStep()`; mass: `exilePlayersPermanentsReturnAtStep(PermanentPredicate, TurnStep)`; immediate: `flickerTarget()` / `flickerTargetWithCounters(int)` / `flickerTargetWithBonus(CardSubtype, CardEffect)`)
- `ExileGraveyardCardsEffect(GraveyardExileScope.TARGET_PLAYER_ENTIRE)` — exile target player's whole graveyard (also: `OWN`, `TARGET_CARDS_ANY_GRAVEYARD` [+`CardTypePredicate`], `TARGET_CARDS_OPPONENT_GRAVEYARD`, `ALL_PLAYERS`, `ALL_OPPONENTS`)
- `ExileAllCreaturesEffect()` — exile all creatures
- `ExileAllPermanentsEffect(PermanentPredicate)` — exile matching permanents
- `PutAllPermanentsOnBottomOfLibraryEffect(PermanentPredicate)` — put all matching permanents on the bottom of their owners' libraries (Hallowed Burial, `new PermanentIsCreaturePredicate()`)
- `PermanentAuctionEffect()` — SPELL: exile all nontoken permanents, then players take turns (controller first) claiming one exiled card each onto the battlefield tapped until the pool empties (Thieves' Auction)
- `IllicitAuctionEffect()` — SPELL (targets a creature): each player may bid life for control of target creature; controller opens at 0, players top the high bid in turn order, high bidder loses that much life (a life loss — can exceed their life total) and gains control indefinitely (Illicit Auction)
- `ExileTargetPermanentAndTrackWithSourceEffect()` — exile + track exiled card with source permanent (cards "exiled with" it)
- `ExileTopCardsToSourceEffect(int)` / `EachPlayerExilesTopCardsToSourceEffect(int)` / `ExileTopCardsOfOpponentLibraryToSourceEffect(int)` — exile top N of a library face down, tracked with source (controller / each player / target opponent — the last is Grimoire Thief, two-player resolves against the single opponent)
- `ExileTopCardsOfTargetOpponentCreateTokenPerChosenColorEffect(DynamicAmount count, CreateTokenEffect tokenTemplate)` — `canTargetPlayer()`; on resolution the controller chooses a colour (`ChoiceContext.ExileTopCardsChosenColorTokensChoice`), the target opponent exiles the top `count` cards of their library, and the controller creates one `tokenTemplate` token per exiled card of that colour (lands excluded, per printed colours). Use `new XValue()` for an `{X}...` cost (Oona, Queen of the Fae)
- `SearchLibraryForCardsToExileWithSourceEffect(CardPredicate filter)` — ON_ENTER_BATTLEFIELD: search library for any number of matching cards, exile each tracked with the source, then shuffle (Endless Horizons, PLAINS). Pair with `PutCardExiledWithSourceIntoHandEffect`
- `PutCardExiledWithSourceIntoHandEffect()` — put one card the controller owns exiled with the source into hand (chooses if several); wrap in `MayEffect`. Endless Horizons upkeep

- `ReturnEnchantedCreatureToBattlefieldUnderOwnersControlOnDeathEffect()` — aura `ON_ENCHANTED_PERMANENT_PUT_INTO_GRAVEYARD` trigger: when the enchanted creature dies, return it to the battlefield under its owner's control (Abduction)
- `ReturnTargetCardFromExileToHandEffect(CardPredicate, boolean ownedOnly)` — exile to hand

## Tokens

- `CreateTokenEffect(...)` — create tokens (many constructors, see EFFECTS_INDEX.md). The count is a `DynamicAmount` (`int` ctors are `Fixed` sugar): any "create a token for each …" or "create X tokens" = this effect + an amount (`XValue`, `PermanentCount`, `CardsInGraveyard`, `CountersOnSource`, `AttachmentsOnSource`, `OpponentPoisonCounters`, `CreatureDeathsThisTurn`, `ColorManaSymbolsAmongControlledPermanents`, `Divided`, …) — never a new effect class
- `CreateTokenEffect.whiteSpirit(int)` — 1/1 white Spirit creature token with flying
- `CreateTokenEffect.blackZombie(int)` — 2/2 black Zombie creature token
- `CreateTokenEffect.whiteSoldier(int)` — 1/1 white Soldier creature token
- `CreateTokenEffect.ofTreasureToken(int)` — treasure tokens
- `PayXManaCreateXTokensEffect(CreateTokenEffect token)` — resolution-time "you may pay {X}. If you do, create X [tokens]": prompts X (≤ available mana), pays it, creates X copies of `token` (X=0 = decline). `token`'s own amount is ignored. Rise of the Hobgoblins. Use this, NOT `MayPayManaEffect("{X}", …)`, which can't pay/plumb `{X}` at resolution
- `CreateTokenWithDyingSourceCountersEffect(CreateTokenEffect template)` — `ON_DEATH`: if the dying creature had ≥1 +1/+1 counter, create `template` with that many +1/+1 counters (e.g. Ambitious Augmenter's Fractal)
- `CreateTokensForEachDyingSourceCounterEffect(CreateTokenEffect template)` — `ON_DEATH`: "create one `template` token for each counter on it." The death collector snapshots the dying creature's total counter count (every concrete counter type) and creates that many copies of `template` (e.g. Kinsbaile Borderguard's 1/1 white Kithkin Soldier)
- `MoveDyingSourceCountersToTargetCreatureEffect()` — `ON_DEATH`: if the dying creature had ≥1 counter (any type), move all of its counters onto up to one target creature (e.g. Scolding Administrator). Intervening-if snapshots the counters at death; targets any creature
- `DrawCardForEachDyingSourceCounterEffect(CounterType counterType)` — `ON_DEATH`: "draw a card for each `counterType` counter on it." Snapshots the dying creature's count of that type at death and draws that many (e.g. Dusk Urchins, MINUS_ONE_MINUS_ONE)
- `PutCounterOnTargetForEachDyingSourceCounterEffect(CounterType counterType)` — `ON_DEATH`: "put a `counterType` counter on target creature for each `counterType` counter on it." Snapshots the dying creature's count at death and puts that many on a targeted creature (mandatory creature target); e.g. Grief Tyrant (MINUS_ONE_MINUS_ONE)
- `MoveCounterFromTargetCreatureToTargetCreatureEffect(boolean moveAll)` — move counters from the first target creature onto the second (reads flat multi-target positions 0/1). `moveAll=false` (also `()`) moves one counter of the first kind present; `moveAll=true` moves every counter of every kind. No-op if the first creature has no counters or either target is gone. As an activated ability pair with the multi-target `ActivatedAbility` constructor + two creature filters (Leech Bonder `{U}, {Q}`); as a spell use two `target(creatureFilter)` groups (Fate Transfer, `moveAll=true`)
- For "create a token that gains [keyword] until end of turn", set `CreateTokenEffect`'s `grantedKeywordsUntilEndOfTurn` (e.g. `new CreateTokenEffect(amount, name, p, t, color, colors, subtypes, innateKeywords, Set.of(Keyword.HASTE))` — Artistic Process Elemental gains haste). Distinct from the token's innate `keywords`.
- `CreateXTokenWithXCountersEffect(String tokenName, int power, int toughness, CardColor color, Set<CardColor> colors, List<CardSubtype> subtypes, CounterType counterType)` — create one token with X counters of `counterType` from ability/spell X value (e.g. Berta's Fractal with `PLUS_ONE_PLUS_ONE`)
- `ExileTargetCardFromGraveyardAndCreateTokenCopyEffect(CardPredicate, ownGraveyardOnly, additionalSubtypes, grantHaste, exileAtEndStep)` — exile graveyard target, create token copy with optional extra subtypes/haste/end-step exile
- `CreateTokenCopyOfTargetPermanentEffect()` or `(grantHaste, exileAtEndStep)` or `(additionalSubtypes, additionalTypes, powerOverride, toughnessOverride, Map<CounterType, Integer> initialCounters)` — create token copy of targeted permanent; optional type/subtype/P/T overrides, post-ETB counters, granted haste, and exile at next end step (Heat Shimmer)
- `CreateTokenCopyOfTargetCreatureForTargetPlayerEffect()` — target player creates a token copy of target creature you control (two targets: player + creature); Echocasting Symposium
- `CreateTokenCopyOfEachControlledCreatureTokenEffect()` — "For each creature token you control, create a token that's a copy of that creature" (populate-all). Snapshots your creature tokens first (new copies aren't copied), respects the token multiplier. No target (Rhys the Redeemed)

## Life

- `GainLifeEffect(DynamicAmount[, GainLifeRecipient])` or `(int)` — gain life; dynamic derivations via `DynamicAmount` (PermanentCount, CardsInHand, CardsInGraveyard, CountersOnSource, GreatestPowerAmongControlled, XValue, Scaled, Sum, `ColorManaSymbolsInHand`, …). Chroma-from-hand "gain N life for each [color] mana symbol in cards in your hand" = `GainLifeEffect(new Scaled(new ColorManaSymbolsInHand(ManaColor.GREEN), N))` (Phosphorescent Feast, N=2; "reveal any number" modelled as the whole hand). `recipient=TARGET_CONTROLLER` gives the life to the target permanent's controller: "its controller gains life = its toughness" = `GainLifeEffect(new TargetToughness(), GainLifeRecipient.TARGET_CONTROLLER)` (Condemn). `TargetPower()` is the power analogue: "you gain life = target's power, then destroy it" = `GainLifeEffect(new TargetPower())` + `DestroyTargetPermanentEffect(false)` (Chastise)
- `TargetPlayerGainsLifeEffect(DynamicAmount|int)` — target gains life (`XValue` for "target player gains X life", Stream of Life)
- `DoubleTargetPlayerLifeEffect()` — double target life
- `SetTargetPlayerLifeToSpecificValueEffect(int)` — set life to value
- `SetEachPlayerLifeToHighestAmongPlayersEffect()` — each player's life total becomes the highest among all players (Arbiter of Knollridge)
- `SetEachPlayerLifeToCreatureCountEffect()` — each player's life total becomes the number of creatures they control (Biorhythm)
- `SetControllerLifeToSpecificValueEffect(int)` — non-targeting "your life total becomes N" (Form of the Dragon end-step trigger)
- `ExchangeTargetPlayersLifeTotalsEffect()` — two target players exchange life totals (Soul Conduit, Axis of Mortality)
- `PsychicTransferEffect()` — targets a player; if controller's and target's life totals differ by 5 or less, they exchange life totals (Psychic Transfer)
- `LoseLifeEffect(DynamicAmount amount, LoseLifeRecipient recipient, boolean controllerGainsLifeLost)` — the whole life-loss family. `recipient` = CONTROLLER / TARGET_PLAYER / EACH_PLAYER / EACH_OPPONENT; `controllerGainsLifeLost` drains total life lost back to you. Sugar: `(int)` = `(Fixed, CONTROLLER, false)` (lose N life), `(int, recipient)`, `(DynamicAmount, recipient)`, `(int, recipient, boolean)`. Amount: `EventValue()` for "equal to the life you gained" (Sanguine Bond `(new EventValue(), TARGET_PLAYER)`); `PermanentCount(filter, CONTROLLER)` for "1 life for each … you control" (Bishop); `new XValue()` for Exsanguinate `(new XValue(), EACH_OPPONENT, true)`. `canTargetPlayer()` = recipient==TARGET_PLAYER
- `TargetPlayerLosesLifeAndControllerGainsLifeEffect(int, int)` — drain target (fixed gain, NOT gains-life-lost)
- `SpellCastLifeDrainEffect(int lifeLoss, int lifeGain, CardPredicate spellFilter)` — `ON_OPPONENT_CASTS_SPELL` drain: opponent who casts a matching spell loses `lifeLoss`, you gain `lifeGain` (filter null = any). Yawgmoth's Edict
- `PlayersCantGainLifeEffect()` — can't gain life (static)
- `TargetPlayerCantGainLifeRestOfGameEffect()` — the stack entry's target player can't gain life for the rest of the game (persistent, per-player). Non-targeting on `ON_DAMAGE_TO_PLAYER`; Stigma Lasher
- `AllDamageDealtWithWitherEffect()` — STATIC global: all damage is dealt as though its source had wither (creature damage becomes -1/-1 counters; player damage normal). Everlasting Torment
- `DoubleLifeGainEffect()` — STATIC: controller's life gain is doubled (Boon Reflection). Applied in `LifeSupport.applyGainLife`; multiple copies stack multiplicatively (2^count)

## Poison counters

- `GivePoisonCountersEffect(int, PoisonRecipient)` — give poison; recipient routes CONTROLLER (self) / TARGET_PLAYER / EACH_PLAYER / ENCHANTED_PERMANENT_CONTROLLER
- `GivePoisonCountersEffect(int, TARGET_PLAYER, CardPredicate spellFilter)` — `ON_CONTROLLER_CASTS_SPELL` trigger descriptor (Hand of the Praetors)

## Creature pump / boost

- `BoostTargetCreatureEffect(DynamicAmount power, DynamicAmount toughness)` or `(int, int)` — target +X/+Y. Any "for each …", "+X/+X" (X paid), or "where X is …" target-pump = this effect + a `model/amount/DynamicAmount` — never a new per-variant class. The amount evaluates against the SOURCE, so counting refers to the effect's controller, not the pumped target. E.g. `(new XValue(), new XValue())` (Untamed Might), `(new PermanentCount(new PermanentIsCreaturePredicate(), CountScope.CONTROLLER), same)` (Elder of Laurels), `(new Sum(new Fixed(1), new CardsInGraveyard(filter, CountScope.CONTROLLER)), new Fixed(0))` (Ancestral Anger)
- `BuffTargetCreatureIndefinitelyEffect(int power, int toughness, Set<Keyword> keywords)` or `(int, int)` — target creature gets +power/+toughness and gains `keywords` **indefinitely** (no duration, CR 611.2b). Use for "this effect lasts indefinitely" pumps (Riding the Dilu Horse); NOT for until-EOT pumps (use `BoostTargetCreatureEffect` + `GrantKeywordEffect`). Recorded as a `PERMANENT` floating continuous effect on the target — +P/+T in sublayer 7c, keywords in layer 6 (read off the float by `GameQueryService.assembleStaticBonus`); copies stack additively
- `CardNamedPredicate(String cardName)` — card filter for exact name match (use with graveyard-count boosts above)
- `BoostSelfEffect(DynamicAmount, DynamicAmount)` or `(int, int)` — self +X/+Y; one-shot in trigger/ability slots, continuous in STATIC. Any "for each …" self-boost = this effect + a `model/amount/DynamicAmount` (`PermanentCount`, `CardsInGraveyard`, `AttachmentsOnSource`, `CreaturesBlockingSource`, `OpponentPoisonCounters`, `ImprintedCreaturePower/Toughness`, `LandsMatchingImprintedName`, `ChosenPermanentPower`, `XValue`, `Scaled`, `Fixed`) — never a new per-variant effect class. `ChosenPermanentPower` = effective power (at resolution) of the permanent chosen during activation, e.g. the creature tapped by `TapCreatureCost(…, trackTappedCreaturePower=true)` — Impelled Giant's "+X/+0 where X is the power of the creature tapped this way"
- `AttachedBoostEffect(DynamicAmount, DynamicAmount, GrantScope)` — STATIC +X/+Y on the enchanted/equipped creature (`ENCHANTED_CREATURE`/`EQUIPPED_CREATURE`). Attached-scope sibling of `BoostSelfEffect`; any "for each …" aura/equipment boost = this effect + a `DynamicAmount`. `CountScope.CONTROLLER` = the aura/equipment's controller (CR 109.5). Negative per-count = wrap in `Scaled(…, -1)`. Blanchwood Armor, Blackblade Reforged, Bonehoard, Runechanter's Pike, Quag Sickness, Strata Scythe — never a new `BoostCreaturePer*` class
- `DoubleSelfPowerToughnessEffect()` — double self P/T
- `BoostAllOwnCreaturesEffect(DynamicAmount, DynamicAmount)` or `(…, PermanentPredicate)` — all own +X/+Y; `(int, int[, PermanentPredicate])` convenience wraps in `Fixed`. Any "where X is …" / power- or graveyard-derived mass own-pump = this effect + a `DynamicAmount` (evaluated once at resolution) — e.g. `new GreatestPowerAmongControlled()` (Overwhelming Stampede), `new CardsInGraveyard(new CardTypePredicate(CREATURE), CONTROLLER)` (Garruk, the Veil-Cursed). Never a new per-variant class
- `BoostAllCreaturesEffect(DynamicAmount, DynamicAmount)` or `(…, PermanentPredicate)` or `(…, PermanentPredicate, EachPermanentScope)` — creatures +X/+Y; `(int, int[, PermanentPredicate])` / `(int, int, EachPermanentScope)` convenience wraps in `Fixed`. Scope `ALL_PLAYERS` (default, both sides) or `TARGET_PLAYER` ("creatures target player controls", `canTargetPlayer`, Shields of Velis Vel). "X paid" mass pump = `new Scaled(new XValue(), mult)` / `new XValue()` (Ichor Explosion, Flowstone Slide)
- `StaticBoostEffect(int, int, Set<Keyword>, GrantScope, PermanentPredicate)` — static +X/+Y + keywords
- `BoostOwnCreaturesByManaSymbolEffect(ManaColor, int powerPerSymbol, int toughnessPerSymbol)` — chroma anthem: each creature you control gets +P/+T per mana symbol of that color in its own cost (hybrid/Phyrexian symbols of that color count). Light from Within
- `SetBasePowerToughnessEffect(int, int)` — set target creature's base P/T until end of turn; `(int, int, GrantScope)` for continuous static (e.g. `ENCHANTED_CREATURE`, Deep Freeze)
- `SetAllOwnCreaturesBasePowerToughnessEffect(DynamicAmount, DynamicAmount)` or `(int, int)` — set base P/T of all creatures you control to X/X until end of turn (layer 7b, modifiers apply on top). X-cost ability = `new XValue()` (Mirror Entity)
- `SetAllUnblockedCreaturesBasePowerToughnessEffect(int, int)` — set base P/T of every unblocked creature (any player's) until end of turn (layer 7b). "Unblocked" = attacking + no blocker, locked in at resolution (Inkfathom Witch)
- `BecomeCreatureTypeWithBasePowerToughnessEffect(int power, int toughness, CardSubtype addedSubtype[, CardSubtype requiredSubtype])` — one-shot non-targeting SELF effect: permanently adds `addedSubtype` (into `grantedSubtypes`) and sets base P/T **indefinitely** (permanent base override, layer 7b via fresh timestamp — not until end of turn). Optional `requiredSubtype` = intervening "if" checked at resolution (source must already have that subtype, granted counts). Figure of Destiny's level-up chain. Pair permanent keyword grants (flying/first strike) as STATIC `ConditionalEffect(new SourceHasSubtype(subtype), new GrantKeywordEffect(kw, SELF))`
- `SwitchPowerToughnessEffect()` — switch P/T

## P/T setting / counters

- `SetPowerToughnessToAmountEffect(DynamicAmount power, DynamicAmount toughness)` — CDA that sets P/T on a 0/0 base (pass the same amount for both). Replaced the `PowerToughnessEqualTo*` family + `BoostSelfBySlimeCountersOnLinkedPermanentEffect`. Amounts: `PermanentCount(IsLand/IsCreature/IsArtifact/HasSubtype…, CONTROLLER)` (lands/creatures/artifacts/Swamps you control), `CardsInGraveyard(filter, CONTROLLER|ANY_PLAYER)`, `CardsInHand(CONTROLLER)` (hand size), `ControllerLifeTotal()` (life total), `CountersOnLinkedPermanent(type, id)` (linked-permanent counters), `ColorManaSymbolsInGraveyard(color, CONTROLLER)` (chroma of graveyard cards — Umbra Stalker = black)
- `PutCountersOnSourceEffect(int power, int toughness, int amount)` — counters on self
- `PutCountersOnSourceEqualToEnteringPowerEffect(int power, int toughness, boolean optional)` — ON_ANY_OTHER_CREATURE_ENTERS_BATTLEFIELD: put counters on self = entering creature's power; `optional` = "you may" (Hamletback Goliath)
- `PutCountersOnSelfEffect(CounterType)` — one counter of a type on self (charge, +1/+1, study, etc.)
- `PutCountersOnSelfEffect(CounterType, int count)` — N counters of a type on self (e.g. Withengar Unbound: 13 +1/+1)
- `PutCountersOnSelfEffect(CounterType, DynamicAmount)` — dynamic count on self, e.g. `(CounterType.TOWER, new XValue())` for "{X}: Put X tower counters" (Helix Pinnacle)
- `PutCounterOnTargetPermanentEffect(CounterType, int)` — counters on target permanent (`PLUS_ONE_PLUS_ONE`/`MINUS_ONE_MINUS_ONE`/…); `(…, new XValue())` for "X counters"; `(…, count, boolean regenerateIfSurvives)` (Gore Vassal); `withTargetRestriction(…, targetPredicate)` to restrict legal targets; `(…, count, PermanentPredicate)` for a non-targeting own-permanent choice
- `PutPlusOnePlusOneCounterOnEachCreatureTargetPlayerControlsEffect()` — +1/+1 on each creature the target player controls (bind to the player target group via `target(...).addEffect(...)`)
- `PutCounterOnEachControlledPermanentEffect(CounterType, int, PermanentPredicate)` — counters on each own permanent matching predicate (use `PermanentIsCreaturePredicate` for "each creature you control")
- `RemoveCounterFromEachControlledPermanentEffect(CounterType, int, PermanentPredicate)` — remove up to N counters from each own permanent matching predicate, clamped at zero (Heartmender's "remove a -1/-1 counter from each creature you control")
- `PutCounterOnEachMatchingPermanentEffect(CounterType, int|DynamicAmount, PermanentPredicate, EachPermanentScope)` — counters on each matching permanent across `ALL_PLAYERS`/`TARGET_PLAYER` (each attacking / other / all creatures; each creature target player controls)
- `PutCounterOnEnchantedCreatureEffect(CounterType)` or `(CounterType, int)` — counter(s) on enchanted creature
- `EnterWithCountersEffect(CounterType, DynamicAmount)` — "enters the battlefield with … counters" (as-enters replacement effect): fixed = `Fixed(n)`, X paid = `XValue()`, "for each …" = a counting amount (`CreatureDeathsThisTurn`, `Sum(PermanentCount(...), CardsInGraveyard(...))`, …). "If kicked" / "Raid —" variants wrap it in `ConditionalEffect(new Kicked()/new Raid(), …)`
- `GraveyardEnterWithAdditionalCountersEffect(CardSubtype, int)` — graveyard static: while in your graveyard, creatures of that subtype you control enter with N extra +1/+1 counters (Dearly Departed / HUMAN)
- `ControlledCreaturesEnterWithAdditionalCountersEffect(CardSubtype, int)` — battlefield static: while on the battlefield, each other creature of that subtype you control enters with N extra +1/+1 counters (Sage of Fables / WIZARD)
- Increment keyword — keyword-driven (`Keyword.INCREMENT`, auto-loaded from Scryfall): +1/+1 counter on self when mana spent on a cast spell exceeds self's current power or toughness. Add nothing to the card; behavior lives in `TriggerCollectionService.collectIncrementTriggers` (resolution effect: `IncrementTriggerEffect`). E.g. Ambitious Augmenter
- `ProliferateEffect()` — proliferate
- `KickerEffect(String cost)` — kicker declaration

## Keywords / abilities

- `GrantKeywordEffect(Keyword, GrantScope)` or `(Keyword, GrantScope, PermanentPredicate)` or `(Set<Keyword>, GrantScope)` — grant keywords. Add a trailing `GrantDuration` (`(Keyword, GrantScope, GrantDuration)` / `(Set<Keyword>, GrantScope, GrantDuration)`) for one-shot duration: `END_OF_TURN` (default) or `UNTIL_YOUR_NEXT_TURN`. In `STATIC` slot the grant is continuous and the duration is ignored. `GrantKeywordEffect.toTargetIf(Keyword, PermanentPredicate grantCondition)` — grant to target ONLY if it matches `grantCondition` (checked at resolution; target stays legal, only the grant is conditional — Vampire's Zeal, Blessing of Belzenlok). `grantCondition` is distinct from `filter`/`targetPredicate()`.
- `RemoveKeywordEffect(Keyword, GrantScope)` or `(Keyword, GrantScope, PermanentPredicate filter)` — one-shot keyword removal until end of turn (floating layer-6 removal). Scopes handled by the normal handler: `SELF`, `TARGET`, and `OPPONENT_CREATURES` (mass removal from every creature opponents control — Invert the Skies strips flying). In `STATIC` slot it's a continuous removal via the static handler's creature-scope matcher.
- `GrantChosenKeywordToTargetEffect(List<Keyword> options)` — prompt to choose one keyword from options, grant to target permanent until end of turn (bind to its target group in multi-target spells — Practiced Offense)
- `GrantFlashToCardTypeEffect(CardPredicate)` — flash to card types (static)
- `GrantConspireToSpellsEffect(CardPredicate)` — spells you cast matching the predicate have conspire (static; Wort, the Raidmother)
- `ActivateCreatureAbilitiesAsThoughHasteEffect()` — controller may activate abilities of creatures they control as though they had haste (static; lifts summoning-sickness on ability activation only, does NOT grant haste — Thousand-Year Elixir)
- `GrantActivatedAbilityEffect(ActivatedAbility, GrantScope)` or `(ActivatedAbility, GrantScope, PermanentPredicate)` — grant ability
- `GrantAdditionalBlockEffect(int)` or `(int, PermanentPredicate controlledFilter)` — block N additional (filter → each controlled permanent matching predicate, e.g. Cenn's Tactician)
- `RegenerateEffect()` or `(boolean targetsPermanent)` — regenerate
- `RegeneratesIfWouldBeDestroyedEffect()` — STATIC self-replacement: "if this creature would be destroyed, regenerate it" — always-on intrinsic regeneration (regenerates every time, no shield consumed); honored by `GraveyardService.tryRegenerate`. Mossbridge Troll
- `ProtectionFromColorsEffect(Set<CardColor>)` — protection from colors (static)
- `ProtectionFromSubtypesEffect(Set<CardSubtype>)` — protection from subtypes (static)
- `ProtectionFromManaValueEffect(int minManaValue)` — protection from sources with mana value ≥ N (static, Mistmeadow Skulk)
- `GrantSubtypeToTargetCreatureEffect(CardSubtype)` — target creature "becomes a [subtype] in addition to its other types" (permanent, added to `grantedSubtypes`)
- `TargetCreatureBecomesSubtypeUntilEndOfTurnEffect(CardSubtype)` — target creature **becomes** the given creature type until end of turn, **replacing** all its other creature types (Boldwyr Intimidator: "target creature becomes a Coward"). Sets `Permanent.transientCreatureTypeOverride`, read by the layered pass; contrast the additive/permanent `GrantSubtypeToTargetCreatureEffect`
- `GrantBasicLandTypeToTargetEffect(EffectDuration[, CardSubtype fixedSubtype][, boolean replacing])` — target land becomes a chosen basic land type. Default adds "in addition to its other types" (Navigator's Compass / Aquitect's Will); `replacing=true` makes the land **become** the type, losing its others per rule 305.7 (Tideshaper Mystic, UNTIL_END_OF_TURN only)
- `NonbasicLandsBecomeTypeEffect(CardSubtype)` — STATIC, global: every nonbasic land (any controller) becomes the basic land type, losing its other land types/abilities and producing that type's mana per rule 305.7. Basic lands unaffected. Blood Moon (MOUNTAIN)
- `OwnLandsBecomeChosenTypeUntilEndOfTurnEffect()` — no target: prompts the controller for a basic land type, then each land they control **becomes** that type until end of turn (type-replacing per rule 305.7, reuses `applyBasicLandType(..., replacing=true)`). Applied once at resolution to lands controlled then. Elsewhere Flask
- `LoseAllCreatureTypesEffect(GrantScope)` — creatures lose all creature types until end of turn; `TARGET` = single creature (Amoeboid Changeling), `TARGET_PLAYERS_CREATURES` = all creatures target player controls (Ego Erasure); "gains all creature types" = `GrantKeywordEffect(Keyword.CHANGELING, sameScope)`
- **Paradigm** (`Keyword.PARADIGM` on card, not an effect) — engine handled by `ParadigmService`: first resolve exiles spell + registers `GameData.ParadigmDelayedTrigger`; each precombat main fires `ParadigmCastCopyEffect` → copy in exile + `ParadigmMayCastFromExileEffect` may-cast (`ParadigmCastSupport`)

## Combat restrictions / evasion

- `CantBeBlockedEffect()` — unblockable (static)
- `CantBeBlockedByFewerThanNCreaturesEffect(int minBlockers)` — generalized menace: can't be blocked except by N+ creatures (static). Menace = 2; Guile = 3
- `CantBeBlockedByCreaturesMatchingPredicateEffect(PermanentPredicate blockerPredicate)` — can't be blocked by blockers matching the predicate (static). Taoist Mystic = `PermanentHasKeywordPredicate(HORSEMANSHIP)`
- `CantBeBlockedIfAttackingAloneEffect()` — can't be blocked while attacking alone (static)
- `AssignCombatDamageAsThoughUnblockedEffect()` — while blocked, may assign combat damage as though unblocked (Rhox/Thorn Elemental) (static)
- `AssignCombatDamageToDefendingCreatureWhenUnblockedEffect()` — while unblocked, may assign all combat damage to one defending creature instead of the player (Cunning Giant) (static). Prompts the attacker via the combat-damage-assignment interaction when the defender has a creature; single recipient only.
- `CantBlockEffect()` — can't block (static)
- `MustAttackEffect()` — must attack (static)
- `MustAttackControllerNextTurnEffect()` — targets a player: during their next turn every creature they control attacks you (the controller) if able (Taunt). SPELL slot; `canTargetPlayer`
- `MustBeBlockedIfAbleEffect()` — must be blocked (static)
- `MustBeBlockedByAllCreaturesEffect()` — Lure (static)
- `MustBeBlockedByAllCreaturesThisTurnEffect()` — one-shot targeted Lure: all creatures able to block target creature this turn do so (Alluring Scent); SPELL slot, `canTargetPermanent`
- `MustBlockTargetCreatureEffect()` — two-target spell: blocker group (0) must block blocked group (1) this turn if able (Hunt Down)
- `EnchantedCreatureCantAttackOrBlockEffect()` — Pacifism (static)
- `ExileEnchantedCreatureEffect()` — exile the creature the source Aura is attached to (exile variant of `SacrificeEnchantedCreatureEffect`); use in an Aura's activated ability (Weight of Conscience). Pairs with the `TapTwoCreaturesSharingTypeCost` activated-ability cost.
- `MakeCreatureUnblockableEffect()` — target unblockable this turn
- `CanBeBlockedOnlyByFilterEffect(PermanentPredicate blockerPredicate, String allowedBlockersDescription)` — static evasion on the source: it can be blocked only by blockers matching the predicate (Fear-like, e.g. Dread Warlock = black creatures)
- `GrantCanBeBlockedOnlyByFilterToOwnCreaturesEffect(PermanentPredicate creatureFilter, PermanentPredicate blockerPredicate, String allowedBlockersDescription)` — SPELL one-shot: your creatures matching `creatureFilter` (null = all) can be blocked only by blockers matching `blockerPredicate` until end of turn. Dread Charge = both filters `PermanentColorInPredicate(BLACK)`. Affected creatures snapshotted at resolution; restriction stored transiently on each `Permanent`
- `MatchingCreaturesCantBlockMatchingCreaturesEffect(PermanentPredicate blockerPredicate, PermanentPredicate attackerPredicate, String description)` — global STATIC: while the source is on the battlefield, any creature matching `blockerPredicate` can't block any creature matching `attackerPredicate`, board-wide (Boldwyr Intimidator: "Cowards can't block Warriors"). Evaluated in `GameQueryService.getBlockRestriction`
- `MatchingCreaturesCantAttackOrBlockEffect(PermanentPredicate affectedPredicate, String description)` — global STATIC: while the source is on the battlefield, any creature matching `affectedPredicate` can't attack OR block, board-wide. Predicate is evaluated relative to the source's controller (`sourceControllerId`/`sourceCardId` set), so source-relative predicates like `PermanentControlledBySourceControllerPredicate` resolve "you"/"your opponents". Kulrath Knight: "Creatures your opponents control with counters on them can't attack or block" = `PermanentAllOfPredicate(PermanentNotPredicate(PermanentControlledBySourceControllerPredicate()), PermanentHasCountersPredicate(ANY))`. Light of Day: "Black creatures can't attack or block" = `PermanentColorInPredicate(BLACK)`. Attack side in `CombatAttackService.isCantAttackDueToGlobalRestriction`, block side in `GameQueryService` (`canBlock` + `buildBlockerFacts`)
- `CantBlockThisTurnEffect(TapUntapScope scope[, PermanentPredicate filter])` — creature(s) can't block this turn (one-shot). `TARGET` (target creature, multi-target-group), `TARGET_PLAYERS_PERMANENTS` (target player's / targeted planeswalker's controller's creatures), `ALL_CREATURES` (mass, filtered). NOT the static `CantBlockEffect()`.
- `TargetPlayerChoosesCreatureRestCantBlockEffect()` — SPELL, `canTargetPlayer`: the targeted player chooses one creature they control (kept able to block); all their OTHER creatures can't block this turn. Pair with a `PlayerPredicateTargetFilter(OPPONENT)`. 0-1 creatures ⇒ no choice, resolves harmlessly (Goblin War Cry).

## Tap / untap

- `EnchantedCreatureDealsDamageEqualToDealtDamageToControllerEffect()` — enchanted creature deals damage equal to amount dealt to its controller (ON_ENCHANTED_CREATURE_DEALT_DAMAGE)
- `TapPermanentsEffect(TapUntapScope.TARGET)` — tap target
- `TapPermanentsEffect(TapUntapScope.SELF)` — tap self · `.ENCHANTED` — tap aura's enchanted creature
- `TapPermanentsEffect(TapUntapScope.TARGET_PLAYERS_PERMANENTS, filter)` — tap that player's matching permanents
- `TapPermanentsEffect(TapUntapScope.ALL_CREATURES, filter)` — tap all creatures matching filter (`PermanentIsAttackingPredicate` = all attackers)
- `UntapPermanentsEffect(TapUntapScope.TARGET[, PermanentPredicate])` — untap target (predicate restricts targets)
- `UntapPermanentsEffect(TapUntapScope.SELF)` — untap self · `.ALL_TARGETS` — untap all targets
- `UntapPermanentsEffect(TapUntapScope.CONTROLLED, filter)` — untap all you control matching · `.OTHER_CONTROLLED_CREATURES` — untap each other creature you control · `.ATTACKED_CREATURES` — untap creatures that attacked this turn · `.ALL_CREATURES[, filter]` — untap every creature on every battlefield matching filter (null = all creatures); Intruder Alarm
- `UntapPermanentsEffect(TapUntapScope.TARGET_PLAYERS_PERMANENTS, filter)` — untap all of target player's permanents matching filter (Early Harvest: `PermanentAllOf(land, BASIC supertype)` = target player's basic lands)
- `UntapEquippedCreatureEffect()` — untap the source Equipment's attached creature (fizzles if unattached). Place on the Equipment in a trigger slot (e.g. `ON_ANY_CREATURE_DIES`) to model equipment-granted untap triggers; Thornbite Staff
- `MatchingPermanentsDoesntUntapEffect(PermanentPredicate)` — global static: every permanent matching the predicate (any controller, incl. the source) doesn't untap during its controller's untap step; Marble Titan (`PermanentPowerAtLeastPredicate(3)`)
- `StorageMatrixEffect()` — global static (Storage Matrix): while any permanent carrying it is untapped, each player's untap step pauses (`UntapStepService.storageMatrixRestrictionApplies`) so the active player chooses artifact/creature/land (a `ColorChoice` with `ChoiceContext.StorageMatrixUntapChoice`); only permanents of the chosen type untap that step. No card-side targeting/config — just `addEffect(EffectSlot.STATIC, new StorageMatrixEffect())`.
- `StaticOrbEffect()` — global static (Static Orb): while any permanent carrying it is untapped, each player's untap step pauses (`UntapStepService.staticOrbRestrictionApplies`, only when >2 permanents would untap) so the active player picks up to two of the permanents that would otherwise untap (a `MultiPermanentChoice` with `MultiPermanentChoiceContext.StaticOrbUntap`, maxCount 2); only those untap that step. No card-side targeting/config — just `addEffect(EffectSlot.STATIC, new StaticOrbEffect())`.
- `DoesntUntapEffect.self()` — this permanent doesn't untap (static) · `.enchanted()` — attached aura/equipment's host doesn't untap (static) · `.targetWhileSourceOnBattlefield()` — target doesn't untap while source on battlefield (Dungeon Geists / Time of Ice) · `.targetWhileSourceTapped()` — while source stays tapped (Rust Tick); TARGET factories piggyback on a companion `TapPermanentsEffect(TapUntapScope.TARGET)`
- `SkipNextUntapEffect(TapUntapScope.TARGET)` — target permanent skips next untap (piggybacks on companion targeting effect) · `.SELF` — source permanent itself skips next untap, non-targeting, for self-referential triggers like `ON_ATTACK` (Lead Golem) · `.TARGET_PLAYERS_PERMANENTS, filter` — that player's matching permanents · `.ALL_CREATURES, filter` — all creatures matching filter (`PermanentIsAttackingPredicate` = all attackers)
- `IfWonClashEffect(wrapped)` — clash-only marker on `EffectSlot.ON_CONTROLLER_CLASHES`: the wrapped effect applies only if the controller won the clash ("If you won, ..."). Consumed by `TriggerCollectionService.fireClashTriggers` at trigger time (not a stack effect). See Entangling Trap: tap target opponent creature + `IfWonClashEffect(SkipNextUntapEffect(TARGET))`. Clash is performed via `performClash` (2-player: both reveal top card, strictly-higher mana value wins).
- `IfLostClashEffect(wrapped)` — mirror of `IfWonClashEffect`: applies only when the controller did **not** win. Pair a won- and lost-variant so exactly one branch fires when the base effect happens regardless of outcome but only a detail differs (Rebellion of the Flamekin: two `MayPayManaEffect("{1}", CreateTokenEffect(...))` differing only in granted `HASTE` on the won branch). Non-targeting clash triggers go straight onto the stack.
- `ClashEffect(List<CardEffect> beforeClash, CardEffect onWin, boolean repeatWhileWinning)` — the clash-*source* stack effect; convenience ctor `ClashEffect(onWin)` = `(List.of(), onWin, false)`. Each iteration dispatches `beforeClash` (via each effect's own handler, against the same entry), performs the clash for the controller via `performClash`, dispatches `onWin` on a win, and with `repeatWhileWinning` repeats the whole sequence until a lost clash (deck-out counts as a loss). "Clash with an opponent. If you win, [X]" = `ClashEffect(X)`; `onWin` may be null for a bare "clash with an opponent". Mirrors `FlipCoinWinEffect`. E.g. Oaken Brawler = `ClashEffect(new PutCountersOnSourceEffect(1, 1, 1))`. "[body], then clash with an opponent. If you win, repeat this process" = `ClashEffect(body, null, true)`: Hoarder's Greed = `ClashEffect(List.of(new LoseLifeEffect(2), new DrawCardEffect(2)), null, true)`. Wrap in `MayEffect` for "you may clash" (Sentry Oak = `MayEffect(ClashEffect(new BoostSelfAndLoseKeywordEffect(2, 0, Keyword.DEFENDER)), ...)`). Delegates `canTargetPermanent`/`canTargetPlayer` to `onWin`/`beforeClash`, so a **targeted** win reward works on any targeting slot: e.g. Springjack Knight "whenever this attacks, clash; if you win, target creature gains double strike" = `target(...)` + `ClashEffect(new GrantKeywordEffect(Keyword.DOUBLE_STRIKE, GrantScope.TARGET))` on `ON_ATTACK` (target chosen when the trigger goes on the stack; grant only on a win). Do **not** wrap an interactive `MayEffect` as a `ClashEffect` win reward — the may-pause re-runs the `ClashEffect` (re-clash). For an *optional* win reward, use a bare `ClashEffect(null)` (records its result on the entry) followed by `ConditionalEffect(new WonClash(), new MayEffect(reward, prompt))`: Whirlpool Whelm = `ClashEffect(null)` + `ConditionalEffect(new WonClash(), new MayEffect(new PutTargetOnTopOfLibraryEffect(), prompt))` + `ReturnToHandEffect.target()`.

## Control / steal

- `GainControlOfTargetEffect(ControlDuration.PERMANENT[, CardSubtype])` — gain control permanently
- `GainControlOfTargetEffect(ControlDuration.END_OF_TURN)` — gain control until EOT
- `GainControlUntapAndHasteTargetEffect()` — Threaten bundle in one effect (gain control until EOT + untap + haste); use when it must be gated by a single `MayEffect` (Dominus of Fealty)
- `GainControlOfTargetEffect(ControlDuration.WHILE_SOURCE_ON_BATTLEFIELD)` — control while source on battlefield
- `GainControlOfAllLandsTargetPlayerControlsEffect()` — gain permanent control of every land the target player controls (`canTargetPlayer`, Gilt-Leaf Archdruid)
- `GainControlOfEnchantedTargetEffect()` — Control Magic (static)
- `ClashForControlOfEnchantedCreatureEffect()` — Captivating Glance: `CONTROLLER_END_STEP_TRIGGERED` Aura effect; clash, then the winner (controller on win, else clash opponent) gains control of the enchanted creature
- `SacrificeEnchantedPermanentAndReattachSourceAuraEffect()` — Nettlevine Blight: `ENCHANTED_PERMANENT_CONTROLLER_END_STEP_TRIGGERED` Aura effect; the enchanted permanent's controller sacrifices it and moves this Aura (keeping its controller) onto another creature/land they control
- `AttachSourceAuraToEnteringCreatureEffect()` — Prison Term: `ON_OPPONENT_CREATURE_ENTERS_BATTLEFIELD` marker; "you may attach this Aura to that creature" moves the Aura onto the entering opponent creature (enter collector queues `MayEffect(AttachSourceAuraToTargetCreatureEffect)`)
- `JuxtaposeEffect()` — Juxtapose: `SPELL`, self-targets a single player (`canTargetPlayer()`). Controller and target player exchange control of their greatest-mana-value creature, then artifact (creatures first, then artifacts on the updated board; artifact creatures can move twice). Ties prompt the controlling player (`JuxtaposeSupport`, `PermanentChoiceContext.JuxtaposeTieBreak`); missing type on a side skips that exchange. Permanent swap via two `GainControlOfTargetEffect(PERMANENT)` floating effects
- `ExchangeControlOfTargetPermanentsEffect()` — Puca's Mischief: `UPKEEP_TRIGGERED`, wrap in `MayEffect`. Reads two `targetIds` — `[0]` a nonland permanent you control, `[1]` a nonland permanent an opponent controls with mana value ≤ target [0]. The two interdependent targets are chosen at trigger time via a bespoke two-step permanent choice (`StepTriggerService.processNextPucasMischiefTarget` → `PucasMischiefOwnTarget`/`PucasMischiefOpponentTarget`, mirroring Capricious Efreet); the "you may" resolves like Axis of Mortality. Re-checks legality at resolution and swaps controllers permanently (CR 701.10)

## Mana

- `AwardManaEffect(ManaColor, DynamicAmount)`, `(ManaColor, int)`, or `(ManaColor)` — add mana; dynamic quantity: `PermanentCount(filter, CONTROLLER)` for "for each X you control", `CountersOnSource(CHARGE)` for "per charge counter", `SourcePower()` for "equal to its power", `FixedIfControlsAllNamed(List<String> names, amount, otherwise)` for the Urza-land ("Tron") boost — `amount` if you control a permanent of every named card, else `otherwise` (e.g. Urza's Mine `AwardManaEffect(COLORLESS, new FixedIfControlsAllNamed(List.of("Urza's Power-Plant", "Urza's Tower"), 2, 1))`)
- `AwardAnyColorManaEffect(int)` or `()` — add any color mana
- `AwardXAnyColorManaEffect()` — add X mana of one chosen color, where X is the ability's xValue (e.g. permanents sacrificed via `SacrificeXPermanentsCost`). X-scaled sibling of `AwardAnyColorManaEffect`; pair with `GainLifeEffect(new XValue())` for "…you gain X life" (Springjack Pasture)
- `AwardManaOfColorsEffect(List<ManaColor>)` or `(List<ManaColor>, int amount)` — add `amount` mana (default 1), each chosen individually from a **fixed list** (single-color list auto-adds, no prompt). Dual/tri producers like Manaforge Cinder (`List.of(BLACK, RED)` = "Add {B} or {R}"). With `amount > 1` each mana's color is picked separately from the same list, re-prompting per pick — filter lands: Fire-Lit Thicket `(List.of(RED, GREEN), 2)` = "Add {R}{R}, {R}{G}, or {G}{G}"
- `AwardOneManaOfEachColorAmongControlledEffect(PermanentPredicate)` — "For each color among permanents you control, add one mana of that color." Adds one mana of **every** color found at once (no choice; contrast `AwardManaOfColorsAmongControlledEffect` which picks one). Bloom Tender = `PermanentTruePredicate`
- `AwardManaOfColorsLandsCouldProduceEffect(ManaColorLandScope, PermanentPredicate)` — add one mana of any color a land in scope matching the predicate could produce. `OPPONENTS` + `PermanentIsLandPredicate` = Fellwar Stone ("a land an opponent controls"); `CONTROLLER` + basic-land predicate = Star Compass ("a basic land you control")
- `MayTapLandsYouDontControlForSpellsUntilEndOfTurnEffect()` — SPELL slot; until EOT, controller may tap lands they don't control for spell-only mana via `GameService.tapForeignLandForMana(...)` (Piracy)
- `DoubleManaPoolEffect()` — double mana pool
- `ManaReflectionEffect()` — STATIC: tapping a permanent for mana produces twice as much of that mana (Mana Reflection). Applied in the mana-ability resolution via `GameQueryService.manaProductionMultiplier`; multiple stack multiplicatively (2^count)
- `TargetPlayerLosesAllUnspentManaEffect()` — targeted player empties their mana pool (all buckets incl. persistent); pair with `PlayerPredicateTargetFilter` (Mana Short)
- `AwardRestrictedManaEffect(ManaColor, int, ManaRestriction)` — restricted mana (`ManaRestriction`: `SpellTypes(Set<CardType>)`, `ArtifactSpells()`, `SubtypeSpells(CardSubtype)`, `KickedCosts()`, `XCosts()`). `XCosts()` = colorless mana spendable only on spells/abilities whose cost contains {X} (Rosheen Meanderer); routes to the `xCostOnlyColorless` pool bucket, usable for any generic portion of an {X} cost
- `AwardFlashbackOnlyAnyColorManaEffect(int)` — flashback-only mana (any-color choice; separate record)
- `AwardAnyColorChosenSubtypeCreatureManaEffect()` — one mana of any color, spendable only on creature spells of the source's chosen subtype (Pillar of Origins / Unclaimed Territory; spell-only)
- `AwardAnyColorSubtypeSpellOrAbilityManaEffect(int, CardSubtype)` — N mana in any combination of colors, spendable only to cast spells of the subtype **or** activate abilities of permanents of that subtype (Smokebraider = `(2, ELEMENTAL)`)

## Copy / clone

- `CopyPermanentOnEnterEffect(PermanentPredicate, String)` + overloads — Clone-style
- `MakeTargetCopyOfTargetCreatureUntilNextTurnEffect()` — **two targets**: target Shapeshifter (`targetIds[0]`) becomes a copy of target creature (`targetIds[1]`) until the controller's next turn (Shapesharer). Wire via the multi-target `ActivatedAbility` ctor
- `BecomeCopyOfTargetCreatureUntilEndOfTurnEffect()` — source permanent becomes a copy of target creature until end of turn (Tilonalli's Skinshifter); `BecomeCopyOfTargetCreatureEffect()` — same, retaining the granting ability (Cryptoplasm)
- `BecomeCopyOfDyingCreatureEffect()` — source permanent becomes a copy of a creature that just died (last-known info from the graveyard), retaining its own death-copy trigger ("except it has this ability"). Cemetery Puca. Place in `ON_ANY_CREATURE_DIES` wrapped in `MayPayManaEffect` for the "you may pay {1}" gate
- `EachOtherCreatureBecomesCopyOfTargetCreatureUntilEndOfTurnEffect()` — every creature on the battlefield **except** the target becomes a copy of the target creature until end of turn (Mirrorweave). Single target; pair with a nonlegendary-creature `PermanentPredicateTargetFilter`. Each copy reverts at cleanup via a per-permanent `BecomeCopyOfTargetCreatureUntilEndOfTurnEffect` floating effect
- `CopySpellEffect()` or `(StackEntryPredicate)` — copy target spell; for "copy twice if cast from a graveyard" add `ConditionalEffect(new CastFromZone(Zone.GRAVEYARD), new CopySpellEffect())` (Increasing Vengeance). Full form `(StackEntryPredicate spellFilter, boolean tokenWithHaste, boolean sacrificeAtEndStep)`: for "copy target **creature** spell; the copy gains haste and is sacrificed at the beginning of the end step", use `new CopySpellEffect(null, true, true)` — the copy becomes a token, gains `HASTE`, and its permanent is registered in `GameData.delayedActions` (a `SacrificeAtEndStep`) (drained by `StepTriggerService.handleEndStepTriggers` via `removePermanentToGraveyard`). `tokenWithHaste` also suppresses the "choose new targets" retarget prompt. Filter which spells are targetable via the mode's `target(...)`/`ChooseOneOption` filter, not `spellFilter`. To make a spell uncopyable, set `card.setCantBeCopied(true)` — honored by every copy handler. See Choreographed Sparks.
- `CopyThisSpellIfConditionEffect(Condition)` — "When you cast this spell, copy it if <condition>. You may choose new targets for the copy." Place in the `ON_SELF_CAST` slot (the spell's own cast trigger); the copy is created with an optional choose-new-targets prompt only when the condition holds at resolution. Used by the SOS Infusion copy cycle (e.g. Lumaret's Favor with `new GainedLifeThisTurn()`)
- `CopyControllerCastSpellOnSpellCastEffect(CardPredicate, TapMultiplePermanentsCost)` — ON_CONTROLLER_CASTS_SPELL: copy cast instant/sorcery; optional tap cost wraps `MayPayTapPermanentsEffect` + `CopyControllerCastSpellEffect` (Aziza, Mage Tower Captain)
- `CopyControllerActivatedAbilityTriggerEffect(String manaCost)` — ON_CONTROLLER_ACTIVATES_NONMANA_ABILITY: "whenever you activate a non-mana ability, you may pay `manaCost` to copy it" — snapshots the ability once it's on the stack, wraps `MayPayManaEffect` + `CopyControllerActivatedAbilityEffect`; single-target copies are retargetable (Rings of Brighthearth)
- `ChangeTargetOfTargetSpellWithSingleTargetEffect()` — redirect spell
- `ChooseNewTargetsForTargetSpellEffect()` — choose new targets

## Turn / phase

- `ControllerExtraTurnEffect(int)` / `ControllerExtraTurnEffect(int, boolean skipUntapStep)` — extra turns (non-targeting); `skipUntapStep=true` makes each granted turn skip its untap step (Savor the Moment)
- `RegisterLoseGameAtEndStepEffect()` — schedules "at the beginning of the next turn's end step, you lose the game" (Last Chance); skips the current turn's end step, fires on the extra turn's
- `ExtraTurnEffect(int)` — target extra turns
- `AdditionalCombatMainPhaseEffect(int)` — additional combat phases
- `SkipNextCombatPhaseEffect()` — ON_COMBAT_DAMAGE_TO_PLAYER: the damaged player skips their next combat phase (Blinding Angel). `(true)` = targeted spell variant where the caster picks the affected player (False Peace)
- `EndTurnEffect()` — end the turn

## Animate / transform

- `AnimatePermanentsEffect(power, toughness, subtypes, keywords, color, cardTypes, GrantScope, EffectDuration, filter)` (+ int-P/T sugar ctors) — one/many permanents become creatures. Scope SELF (manland/self, UEOT), TARGET (single, UEOT via Elvish Branchbender / PERMANENT via Tezzeret / WHILE_SOURCE_ON_BATTLEFIELD via Awakener Druid; **multi-target UEOT reads `targetIds` for "up to N target" abilities — Fendeep Summoner**), OWN_LANDS (Sylvan Awakening), ALL_LANDS (every land on the battlefield, both players — Natural Affinity), OWN_PERMANENTS+filter (The Antiquities War). Wire multi-target via the multi-target `ActivatedAbility` ctor (per-position filters, minTargets/maxTargets). P/T `DynamicAmount` (`XValue`/`CountersOnSource`); null P/T = printed
- `AnimatePermanentsEffect.crew()` — vehicle crew (printed P/T, +CREATURE)
- `AllLandsAreCreaturesEffect(power, toughness[, CardSubtype requiredSubtype])` — STATIC global: lands (both players') are fixed-P/T creatures that are still lands while the source is out. No subtype = every land (Nature's Revolt = 2/2); with a land subtype = only lands carrying it (Living Lands = all Forests become 1/1). Reverts when it leaves; anthems/lords see the animated lands
- `AnimateNoncreatureArtifactsEffect()` — STATIC global: every noncreature artifact becomes a creature with P/T = its mana value (March of the Machines)
- `TransformSelfEffect()` — transform DFC
- `TransformSelfAndAttachToCreatureDamagedPlayerControlsEffect()` — combat-damage "you may transform; if you do, attach to target creature that player controls" (wrap in `MayEffect`)
- `TransformAllEffect(PermanentPredicate)` — transform all matching
- `PreventTransformEffect(PermanentPredicate)` — STATIC: permanents you control matching the predicate can't transform (e.g. Immerwolf)

## Static restrictions / taxes

- `EntersTappedEffect()` — enters tapped
- Conditional enters-tapped (check/fast/slow lands): `ConditionalReplacementEffect(condition, new EntersTappedEffect())` where the condition is the **negated** unless-clause (true ⇒ enters tapped), evaluated at entry against the entering permanent's controller (the permanent isn't on the battlefield yet, so counts exclude it). Check land = `ControlsPermanentCountAtMost(0, PermanentHasAnySubtypePredicate)` (tapped unless you control a matching permanent); fast land "unless N-or-fewer other lands" = `ControlsPermanentCount(N+1, new PermanentIsLandPredicate())`; slow land "unless N-or-more other lands" = `ControlsPermanentCountAtMost(N-1, new PermanentIsLandPredicate())`. **Never add a per-cycle enters-tapped record.**
- `RevealSubtypeOrEntersTappedEffect(subtype)` — STATIC: "you may reveal a [subtype] card from hand as it enters; if you don't (or can't), it enters tapped" (Lorwyn dual lands, e.g. Ancient Amphitheater = GIANT)
- `NoMaximumHandSizeEffect()` — no max hand size (static)
- `IncreaseOpponentCastCostEffect(Set<CardType>, int)` — opponents' spells cost more
- `IncreaseOwnCastCostEffect(CardPredicate, int)` — matching spells cost N more, but only when cast by the source's controller (self-scoped; e.g. Derelor `CardColorPredicate(BLACK)`, 1 — "Black spells you cast cost {B} more", {B} modeled as +1 generic)
- `IncreaseSpellCostExceptOnControllersTurnEffect(int)` — every spell costs N more (symmetric), except during the spell's controller's own turn (Defense Grid, {3})
- `IncreaseOpponentCostForTargetingControlledPermanentEffect(PermanentPredicate, int)` — opponent spells/abilities targeting your matching permanent cost more
- `IncreaseOwnCastCostUnlessRevealSubtypeEffect(int amount, CardSubtype)` — spell-self (STATIC): costs `amount` more unless you can reveal a matching-subtype card from hand (other than the spell). Lorwyn "reveal a creature-type card or pay {N}" cycle (Goldmeadow Stalwart: Kithkin/{3})
- `ReduceOwnCastCostEffect(DynamicAmount)` — **THE spell-self cost reduction.** `Fixed(N)` for a flat amount; a counting amount for "for each …" (Ghoultree `CardsInGraveyard(CardTypePredicate(CREATURE), CONTROLLER)`, Blasphemous Act `PermanentCount(PermanentIsCreaturePredicate, ANY_PLAYER)`). Conditional reductions wrap it: `ConditionalEffect(condition, ReduceOwnCastCostEffect(Fixed(N)))` — Metalcraft (Stoic Rebuttal), ControlsPermanent (Academy Journeymage / Wizard's Retort / Wizard's Lightning / Lookout's Dispersal), OpponentControlsMoreCreatures (Avatar of Might), CardsLeftGraveyardThisTurn (Wilt in the Heat). **Never add a per-variant record for this.** Exception: when the gating condition would read effective P/T, do **not** use `ConditionalEffect` on `STATIC` — the static-bonus path evaluates the condition and computing effective toughness recurses. Instead fold the gate into a threshold amount so it's only evaluated by the cost handler at cast time: `ReduceOwnCastCostEffect(new FixedIfControlledCreaturesTotalToughnessAtLeast(M, N))` — "costs {N} less if creatures you control have total toughness M+" (Orysa, Tide Choreographer).
- `ReduceOwnCastCostForCardTypeEffect(Set<CardType>, DynamicAmount)` — own spells of the given types cost less (battlefield permanent, Heartless Summoning)
- `ReduceOwnCastCostForSharedCardTypeWithImprintEffect(DynamicAmount)` — controller's spells sharing a card type with the imprinted card cost less (Semblance Anvil)
- `ReduceCastCostForMatchingSpellsEffect(CardPredicate, int, CostModificationScope)` — matching spells cost less (SELF = yours, OPPONENT = opponents'; e.g. CardSubtypePredicate, CardIsHistoricPredicate, CardAnyOfPredicate)
- `ReduceOwnCastCostIfTargetingControlledPermanentEffect(PermanentPredicate, int)` — this spell costs less if first target is your matching permanent (kept as its own record — target-gated)
- `ReduceOwnCastCostIfTargetingStackEntryEffect(StackEntryPredicate, int)` — this spell costs less if first target is a spell on the stack matching the predicate (kept — target-gated)
- `ReduceOwnCastCostIfTargetingPermanentEffect(PermanentPredicate, int)` — this spell costs less if first target matches predicate, any controller (kept — target-gated)
- `ReduceActivationCostPerCounterEffect(CounterType, int reductionPerCounter)` — CostEffect placed in an ActivatedAbility's effect list; reduces the generic mana of the activation cost by N per counter of the given type on the source (floored at 0).

- `AlternativeCostForSpellsEffect(String, CardPredicate)` — alternative cast cost
- `PlayersCantCastSpellsFromZonesEffect(Set<Zone> zones)` — no player can cast from any zone in `zones` (static, global; only `GRAVEYARD`/`LIBRARY` enforced — Ashes of the Abhorrent passes `Set.of(GRAVEYARD)`, Grafdigger's Cage passes `Set.of(GRAVEYARD, LIBRARY)`)

- `TargetPlayerCantCastCreatureSpellsThisTurnEffect()` — target player can't cast creature spells for the rest of this turn (spell; declare a player target via `target(...)`). Moonhold ({W} clause)
- `WardOfBonesEffect()` — static; each opponent controlling more creatures/artifacts/enchantments than the controller can't cast spells of that type (compared independently), and each opponent controlling more lands can't play lands. Controller never restricted. Ward of Bones
- `CardsCantEnterBattlefieldFromZonesEffect(CardPredicate filter, Set<Zone> zones)` — cards matching `filter` (null = all) can't enter the battlefield from any zone in `zones`; blocks reanimation/undying/library-search-to-battlefield (static, global; only `GRAVEYARD`/`LIBRARY` enforced — Grafdigger's Cage passes `CardTypePredicate(CREATURE)` and `Set.of(GRAVEYARD, LIBRARY)`)

## Choose / name

- `ChooseCardNameOnEnterEffect()` — choose card name ETB
- `PlayerHasProtectionFromChosenNameEffect()` — STATIC; controller has protection from the chosen card name (Runed Halo); pair with `ChooseCardNameOnEnterEffect()`
- `BoobyTrapEffect()` — STATIC marker; chosen player reveals draws + name-match sac/10-damage trigger (Booby Trap), detected in DrawService
- `RevealFirstDrawDrawOnBasicLandEffect()` — STATIC marker; controller reveals the first card they draw each turn, and if it's a basic land a "draw a card" trigger goes on the stack (Rowen), detected in DrawService (only the turn's first draw is revealed)
- `ChooseColorOnEnterEffect()` — choose color ETB
- `AllNonlandPermanentsAreChosenColorEffect()` — STATIC layer-5 color setter: all nonland permanents (any controller, incl. source) become the source's chosen color, replacing other colors. Pair with `ChooseColorOnEnterEffect` (Shifting Sky)
- `AllPermanentsGainChosenColorEffect()` — STATIC layer-5 additive color grant: all permanents (any controller, including lands and the source) gain the source's chosen color *in addition to* their other colors (not replacing). Pair with `ChooseColorOnEnterEffect` (Painter's Servant). Battlefield permanents only — does not recolor spells on the stack or cards in other zones
- `BecomeAllColorsUntilEndOfTurnEffect()` — self-scoped layer-5 color set: the source permanent becomes all five colors until end of turn (no target/choice). Floats a `BecomeChosenColorsUntilEndOfTurnEffect` with every color on the source (Scrapbasket `{1}:`)
